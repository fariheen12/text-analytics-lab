244646,B0011MFW4A,A1XPVB515QTX7N,D. Brandt,2,3,5,1333065600,Good for my kids allergies & GRANOLA BAR RECIPE,"My kids have many food allergies sensitivities and this mix is fine for them to eat. It is a nice mix and sweet enough to feel like a treat. However, my kids (6, 5 & 3 years old) tend to pick out the fruit pieces they like and leave the rest...even though they like those other ingredients when served separately.<br /><br />This trail mix now serves a new purpose for us. Recently we stopped ordering the Enjoy Life granola bars due to the brown rice syrup and the reports that some brown rice syrup contains arsenic. I have figured out how to make my own granola bars using this mix and a few other ingredients. Here is the recipe in case anyone else is interested:<br /><br />3 bags Enjoy Life No Nuts Seed and Fruit mix (I bet any of the blends would work)<br />1/4 Cup Coconut Flour<br />1/4 Cup Ground Flax Seeds<br />1/4 Cup Cacao Nibs (these are unsweetened, and optional. I'm sure the Enjoy Life mini chocolate chips would be great in here too, or raisins...)<br /><br />In case you are unfamiliar with any of the ingredients here are samples of each:<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011MFW4A"">Enjoy Life not nuts! Beach Bash Nut Free Trail Mix, Gluten, Dairy & Nut Free,  6-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019GZ7Z2"">Bob's Red Mill Organic Coconut Flour -- 16 oz</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDBQ6A"">Bob's Red Mill Organic  Flaxseed Meal, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL9GI"">Navitas Naturals Cacao Nibs, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />You could add a little honey or other sweetener, but we don't. The fruit in it makes it just sweet enough. However, due to my kids' allergies they are used to this type of food. If you are just converting off a typical American diet, you might want it sweeter. Also, this recipe seems pretty forgiving if you want to experiment. I might try some with sunflower butter. I bet it would good, but this way is tasty and pretty simple, and I'm not sure that I want to add any more $ to these since we already go through 2-3 batches a week.<br /><br />Before you start, preheat the oven to 300-350. (This is important if you want to do it the busy mom way.) Put it all in the food processor and let  it become very fine granules, it will take a few minutes. Add 1/2 cup extremely hot water and keep it whizzing in the food processor for just a minute or so to mix it together. Pour into a pan. I use an 11 inch by 7 inch Pyrex pan. It helps if you grease the bottom. The mixture is very sticky, so spreading it out evenly is a little tricky. I use a large metal spatula-type thing that is actually for cutting dough. The parts that stick to the spatula I take off and put in the corners of the pan. I'm able to get it nice and smooth, just expect it to be thick and sticky. Next bake it for 10-15 minutes, or put it in and turn off the oven so you don't have to remember it. That's what I do and it works great. I just let it stay in there until I'm ready to cut it into bars or squares. It is much easier to cut if you wait for it to cool completely.<br /><br />So, now that I am using this to make granola bars, we are going through a lot of this. But it's healthy and free of all the allergens my kids have. I hope this helps someone.<br /><br />In case anyone is wondering about ingredients. The bags I just got (with a new designed tan, orange and brown bag) list this:<br />Raw Sunflower Kernels, Pineapples*, Roasted Hulled Pumkin Seeds (Sunflower Oil (Sunflower Oil, Citric Acid), salt), Cranberries*, Apricots*.<br />*Sulfite-free<br />Also, they expire in September of this year...so, about 6 months from when I got them.",kids many food allergies sensitivities mix fine eat nice mix sweet enough feel like treat however kids years old tend pick fruit pieces like leave resteven though like ingredients served separatelybr br trail mix serves new purpose us recently stopped ordering enjoy life granola bars due brown rice syrup reports brown rice syrup contains arsenic figured make granola bars using mix ingredients recipe case anyone else interestedbr br bags enjoy life nuts seed fruit mix bet blends would workbr cup coconut flourbr cup ground flax seedsbr cup cacao nibs unsweetened optional im sure enjoy life mini chocolate chips would great raisinsbr br case unfamiliar ingredients samples eachbr hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbmfwaenjoy life nuts beach bash nut free trail mix gluten dairy nut free ounce bags pack abr hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbgzzbobs red mill organic coconut flour ozabr hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbedbqabobs red mill organic flaxseed meal ounce packages pack abr hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbellginavitas naturals cacao nibs ounce pouches pack abr br could add little honey sweetener dont fruit makes sweet enough however due kids allergies used type food converting typical american diet might want sweeter also recipe seems pretty forgiving want experiment might try sunflower butter bet would good way tasty pretty simple im sure want add since already go batches weekbr br start preheat oven important want busy mom way put food processor let become fine granules take minutes add cup extremely hot water keep whizzing food processor minute mix together pour pan use inch inch pyrex pan helps grease bottom mixture sticky spreading evenly little tricky use large metal spatulatype thing actually cutting dough parts stick spatula take put corners pan im able get nice smooth expect thick sticky next bake minutes put turn oven dont remember thats works great let stay im ready cut bars squares much easier cut wait cool completelybr br using make granola bars going lot healthy free allergens kids hope helps someonebr br case anyone wondering ingredients bags got new designed tan orange brown bag list thisbr raw sunflower kernels pineapples roasted hulled pumkin seeds sunflower oil sunflower oil citric acid salt cranberries apricotsbr sulfitefreebr also expire september yearso months got

I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day.

I am a coconut water fan and have tried them all.  ONE used to be the best before they move their production to another country.  There is something about coconuts from Brazil.  They are not as sweet and offer a more nutty flavor if that's what you are looking for.<br /><br />This brand has a very subtle taste so if you coming from the sweeter brands, you will not like it.  With all the other brands moving their production to other countries and no longer using coconuts from Brazil, this is my favorite.<br /><br />Below is a review from about about year and half ago.<br /><br />I have tried about 5 brands of coconut water, Amy and Bryans, ONE, Nature Factor, Zico, and VitaCoco.  This one has the most subtle taste of all of them and looking at the nutritional listing on the box, seems to contain the least amount of sugar.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this.

Additionally, both of us detected no hint of berry or kiwi flavor.  Neither of these problems is surprising when looking at the ingredients.  It is made from juice concentrates + water to reconstitute, and the first two juices are apple and grape, so no wonder it tastes like apple (or white grape).  The mild carbonation that is there is insufficient to cut the excessive sugariness of this juice, which makes it have a very think and non-refreshing mouth-feel.  I think it needs more carbonated water (or serve with crushed ice and let it melt for a while), and it definitely needs more actual  kiwi and berry fruit flavor.<br /><br />Next we compared Switch Kiwi Berry to Trader Joe's similar Strawberry Kiwi Juice.  The Trader Joe's juice actually tastes like strawberry & kiwi, and is not too sweet, and not too thick on the tongue to be refreshing.  So it is possible to make a juice of these flavors that is actually good.<br /><br />Finally, it is in a very stylish slim can, which means that it does not hold very much: 8 oz specifically (the usual canned soft drink contains 12 oz).<br /><br />By the way, fruit sugar (fructose) is still sugar, and this drink is full of it.  When they say ""no *added* sugar"", that means they didn't add any *more* to the overly sweet apple and grape concentrates they were using, which is not the same thing as saying ""no sugar"" or ""no sucrose"" (table sugar).<br /><br />disclaimer: we do not drink sugary soft drinks, so if you do, you may like this one.",summary way sweet berrykiwi flavor small servingbr br upon first taste us found juice excessively concentrated sweetness additionally us detected hint berry kiwi flavor neither problems surprising looking ingredients made juice concentrates water reconstitute first two juices apple grape wonder tastes like apple white grape mild carbonation insufficient cut excessive sugariness juice makes think nonrefreshing mouthfeel think needs carbonated water serve crushed ice let melt definitely needs actual kiwi berry fruit flavorbr br next compared switch kiwi berry trader joes similar strawberry kiwi juice trader joes juice actually tastes like strawberry kiwi sweet thick tongue refreshing possible make juice flavors actually goodbr br finally stylish slim means hold much oz specifically usual canned soft drink contains ozbr br way fruit sugar fructose still sugar drink full say added sugar means didnt add overly sweet apple grape concentrates using thing saying sugar sucrose table sugarbr br disclaimer drink sugary soft drinks may like one

My cat, although he isn't thrilled with getting the occasional ""tummy pill,"" does do pretty well with them and doesn't usually throw too bad of a fit. My girlfriend's cat on the other hand, is quite the opposite. That little bugger will throw one of the biggest fits you ever seen when you attempt to give him a pill. You would think that we are trying to give him a bath he throws such a fit, which is another story all together!<br /><br />Anyhow, we bought some of these ""pill hiding treats"" in an attempt to get him to take his medicine without the daily fight that is usually attached to the act of pill taking.

Needless to say, these ""pill pockets"" worked!<br /><br />We were literally amazed the first time that we gave him one with a pill in it and he actually gulped it down without even tasting it. Oh, what joy swept through our household. Little did we know that it was only going to last about 2 weeks.

Approximately two weeks into the ""pill hiding treat"" debacle, we started finding his pill on the floor but no sign of the pill pocket. We soon discovered that the little bugger was chewing the pill pocket off from around the pill and eating it without eating the pill.<br /><br />Now we give him several ""pill hiding treats"" throughout the day, and only one of them has the pill in it, but he never knows which one it is.

I can no longer have sugar due to health issues and Mio makes it a lot easier for me to drink water. The container the Mio is in is leak-proof, so it is very portable and easy to take with you anywhere. You can also mix it in ANY amount of liquid and in any container. I have always hated that you have to have a plastic bottle to mix drink packets. With Mio you just have to briefly stir it in order to have the liquid completely mixed in.<br /><br />You choose how much Mio to add to your water. If you like it strong and sweet, just add more Mio. If you want your flavor faint, then add only a tiny bit. It is easy, delicious and it doesn't have calories, carbs or sugar. The only bad thing I can say about Mio is that there is a lot of coloring and it can stain your clothes or desk. I do wish that it had less coloring.<br /><br />The Fruit Punch flavor is one of my favorite. I always hated the heavy aftertaste of Koolaid and had to water it down to make it taste like an ""adult"" version. Mio tastes like the watered-down Koolaid only better. As I said previously, you can add more or less depending on your preferences. If you make it too strong, just add more water. It is completely customizable.<br /><br />The Fruit Punch is my Husband's favorite flavor and my second favorite. You can literally add this to anything and I prefer it in carbonated water. We have a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KYT6CS"">Sodastream Fountain Jet Soda Maker Starter Kit</a> and we use it to carbonate Mio flavored water. It is delicious.

Life is good."" ~tea packet<br /><br />If you want a subtle tea with a smooth, soothing flavor, then Darjeeling is an excellent choice. The slightly floral flavor is much milder than an Earl Grey. I especially love this blend when eating a Caramel Apple Cobbler Clif Bar. For some reason, the flavors mingle nicely.<br /><br />While many of the Tazo teas are blends of a variety of teas, this tea is purely a blend of Organic Black Darjeeling teas. The tea is grown near India's border with Bhutan. There are only ""true Darjeeling"" tea leaves in this tea.<br /><br />This tea is just perfect when blended with an Organic Sucanat: Natural Sugar Cane. You might also want to try using ""milk powder"" instead of cold milk with your tea. I find it helps to keep the tea strength and adds a creamy element to the smoothness of this tea.<br /><br />Darjeeling is a very satisfying blend for morning tea. You might also enjoy AWAKE and Earl Grey if you enjoy this tea.<br /><br />I just love the packaging of the Tazo Teas. The individual wrappings have a nice crinkly sound and the colors are all so soothing and quite beautiful. These teas are definitely for the aesthetically aware. Drinking Tazo teas literally becomes a magical experience. There is something mysterious going on here. The teas even seem to have a magical glint or luster to them. When you drink Tazo teas the world looks more beautiful and you feel much more aware of life itself. I find that my creativity soars after drinking Tazo teas.<br /><br />For more information on the mysteries of Tazo Tea, read the review for the Tazo Assorted Teas.<br /><br />For a calming experience try the Tazo Calm Herbal Infusion which is perfect for quiet evenings, after completing a yoga workout or just to sip on while you write in your journal.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",sitting porch bungalow tea plantation darjeeling see peaks everest kanchenjunga sip cup exquisite brew life good tea packetbr br want subtle tea smooth soothing flavor darjeeling excellent choice slightly floral flavor much milder earl grey especially love blend eating caramel apple cobbler clif bar reason flavors mingle nicelybr br many tazo teas blends variety teas tea purely blend organic black darjeeling teas tea grown near indias border bhutan true darjeeling tea leaves teabr br tea perfect blended organic sucanat natural sugar cane might also want try using milk powder instead cold milk tea find helps keep tea strength adds creamy element smoothness teabr br darjeeling satisfying blend morning tea might also enjoy awake earl grey enjoy teabr br love packaging tazo teas individual wrappings nice crinkly sound colors soothing quite beautiful teas definitely aesthetically aware drinking tazo teas literally becomes magical experience something mysterious going teas even seem magical glint luster drink tazo teas world looks beautiful feel much aware life find creativity soars drinking tazo teasbr br information mysteries tazo tea read review tazo assorted teasbr br calming experience try tazo calm herbal infusion perfect quiet evenings completing yoga workout sip write journalbr br rebecca review

It comes out completely moist with a medium brown color crust, not a light one - I think maybe GF grains brown at a different rate than wheat?  A couple of caveats:<br /><br />1. This product package has several recipes on the side - very helpful! However, to get it to turn out using the recipe, you have to assume using JUMBO eggs, or you'll need to add some extra egg whites to get the right volume of egg product.<br /><br />2. EXPERIMENT some: You can play around with adding a little sugar or Agave nectar or brown sugar to tweak the taste out the way you like it, but if you use as much as the sweet bread recipe (on side of package) calls for, you'll end up with such sweetness that it really works only as a breakfast or dessert product. You can use cooking oil instead of butter in the recipe for greater moisture, and you can sub milk or soy milk or almond milk for part or all of the water requirements, as long as you don't change the total amount of liquid from the total amount called for in the recipe.

Be sure to remove the loaf from the pan immediately upon completing the baking cycle, and leave it in open air to circulate around it (for instance, on a wire rack or cool eye of the stove) until it is completely cool. This will not harden the crust much at all, but it will prevent premature molding. Then put the cooled loaf into a ziploc bag or other bread container. Doing so gives the finished loaf a shelf life of a week at room temperature for me, even though I currently live in a humid climate (where other GF breads mold in about 3 days). This is important, because GF grains usually aren't bleached, and so they'll mold faster than flours made from traditional gluteny grains like white flour, etc.<br /><br />This is my FAVORITE gluten-free bread mix.  :-)  My friends who don't have to avoid gluten and who typically shun whatever is gluten free actually request me to make this GF bread for them.",love mix much subscription amazon see subscribe save even shop gf stuff subscriptions br br make hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbtjizojirushi bbccx home bakery supreme bread machinea set quick cycle light crust color comes completely moist medium brown color crust light one think maybe gf grains brown different rate wheat couple caveatsbr br product package several recipes side helpful however get turn using recipe assume using jumbo eggs youll need add extra egg whites get right volume egg productbr br experiment play around adding little sugar agave nectar brown sugar tweak taste way like use much sweet bread recipe side package calls youll end sweetness really works breakfast dessert product use cooking oil instead butter recipe greater moisture sub milk soy milk almond milk part water requirements long dont change total amount liquid total amount called recipe play around get way personally prefer get creative add stuff like cheeses olives nuts seasonings enjoy funbr br sure remove loaf pan immediately upon completing baking cycle leave open air circulate around instance wire rack cool eye stove completely cool harden crust much prevent premature molding put cooled loaf ziploc bag bread container gives finished loaf shelf life week room temperature even though currently live humid climate gf breads mold days important gf grains usually arent bleached theyll mold faster flours made traditional gluteny grains like white flour etcbr br favorite glutenfree bread mix friends dont avoid gluten typically shun whatever gluten free actually request make gf bread

Low Quality.,"Fortunately, I've never been gluten sensitive, at least as far as I know, but I've got a couple friends that are on gluten-free diets. This seems to be one of those things that wasn't even recognized a couple decades ago and now everyone seems to be worried about gluten. Gosh, I was at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market the other day and found that they even had a gluten-free section with all kinds of gluten-free products. I was amazed. I looked over the selection and decided to try a can of the Gluten Free Cafe Chicken Noodle Soup. I was very disappointed with the soup. First of all, the picture on the can shows an abundance of chicken and noodles. In reality, the broth is by far the main constituent of the can.  When you empty the entire can into a bowl, the chicken, noodles and vegetables don't even show. The chicken is somewhat dry, tough and woody and lacks good flavor. The noodles strike me as being badly overcooked, at least for my taste. The flavor of the broth is weak and the sodium content is high. Gosh, I had a can of this soup (not a very fulfilling meal) and took in about 60% of my daily value of sodium. I suppose this might be an appropriate item if you have gluten problems, but I don't. There are a lot better Chicken Noodle soups around if you aren't worried about the gluten problem.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",fortunately ive never gluten sensitive least far know ive got couple friends glutenfree diets seems one things wasnt even recognized couple decades ago everyone seems worried gluten gosh nearby fresh easy neighborhood market day found even glutenfree section kinds glutenfree products amazed looked selection decided try gluten free cafe chicken noodle soup disappointed soup first picture shows abundance chicken noodles reality broth far main constituent empty entire bowl chicken noodles vegetables dont even show chicken somewhat dry tough woody lacks good flavor noodles strike badly overcooked least taste flavor broth weak sodium content high gosh soup fulfilling meal took daily value sodium suppose might appropriate item gluten problems dont lot better chicken noodle soups around arent worried gluten problembr br gary peterson

Reck ""CitizenPete""",2,2,4,1350518400,Ordered both Thick and Filets products - COLD PACKED FOOD,"I am double posting this review for both the thick cut and filet versions of this product. So you may see it twice -- YES, I did order BOTH products.<br /><br />1) This product comes COLD packed in a wine brine with onions (as was expected) - read this next part carefully:<br /><br />This is a cold product - IT MUST BE SHIPPED and KEPT REFRIGERATED, because it has no preservatives.<br /><br />Make certain you have ROOM in your fridge for the jar(s) which are slightly different than the one pictured (thinner diameter straight wide-mouth jar and taller, which makes then easier to fit in the fridge).<br /><br />2) If you don't normally consume this product in this form (packed in wine sauce) then don't buy it. It would probably be considered to be an ""acquired taste"" by most. Buy a small jar in a local grocery first to try. If you like it then order this larger jar.<br /><br />3) This brand does appear to have a stronger fish taste (up against the brine), than other brands I have tried. The fish taste is stronger on the thick cut product, which may be preferred, depending on your tastes. My guess is that would diminish over time while marinating in the ""wine"" and onion based brine.<br /><br />4) I suggest that you might try just one jar at a time. Remember IT MUST BE KEPT REFRIGERATED -- it can NOT be stored without being refrigerated in a pantry.<br /><br />5)This brand is pricey with shipping costs. You may be able to purchase locally if you don't require Canadian packed herring.<br /><br />6) Eating fish may be good for you, and if you like this type of product, it might be an easy way to consume larger amounts of Omega fats other than downing supplements. You could live longer, but you will need to brush your teeth or chew gum more, or you may become an old person with fish breath. ;)<br /><br />Finally I should note that this was the second shipment sent, but I never saw the first box which I was told was damaged during delivery.  The product was cold packed with freezer packs in a polystyrene lined box. Parthenon Foods sent an email about the damaged shipment and offered refund or re-delivery -- no hassles.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

It turns out that her problem was in fact due to corn and other fillers used in lesser quality dog foods (in this case, Purina One). Overall, this product alone made it completely worth the cost to subscribe to Amazon Prime for the extremely fast and cheap shipping, so for less money (as Kitty now requires less food, since she's more full from eating less of the higher quality food and we make sure to only feed her what the vet recommends,) I no longer have to drive to the store and pick up a 40 pound bag of dog food and load it into the back of one of my GTIs. So far, Kitty's been gaining weight and muscle at a pretty decent rate, in my opinion. (Over the past 2 months, she's gone from approximately 59 pounds to 67.5 pounds currently, and is quite fit and happy.) All this, is of course in addition to daily exercise, walks, et cetera, but her temperament lately has also been much better. On the lesser quality dog chow, she used to mope around the house every few days, but lately, she's been very happy, energetic and outgoing. She seems to be much less easily stressed out, which is great for her, as she tend to be a bit anxious, although an absolute sweetheart.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I could not recommend this or any other Canidae Dog Food product highly enough.

I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty.

Overall, this product alone made it completely worth the cost to subscribe to Amazon Prime for the extremely fast and cheap shipping, so for less money (as Kitty now requires less food, since she's more full from eating less of the higher quality food and we make sure to only feed her what the vet recommends,) I no longer have to drive to the store and pick up a 40 pound bag of dog food and load it into the back of one of my GTIs. So far, Kitty's been gaining weight and muscle at a pretty decent rate, in my opinion.

Light and fruity, but not juice-like, full bodied but not overpowering. I drink quite a bit of tea and have made a point of trying many different teas, but this is a genuinely unique experience.<br /><br />I did have a hard time swallowing the price of this stuff initially, but it is well worth its price for several reasons. Aside from how incredibly good this tea really is, it does not take a lot of loose leaf to brew a strong cup. 4 ounces of this loose leaf should brew (rough estimate based on my usage so far) at least 30 to 40 cups. Even factoring in the cost of sweetener if you decide to use any, the cost of a single cup is still well under a dollar. Given the $2-3 cost of hot tap water and a bulk packaged tea bag at the popular coffee shops, this stuff is a phenomenal bargain. It is still pricier than buying a typical box of tea bags in the grocery store, but not by very much, and the product is vastly superior.<br /><br />You can steep this tea twice. I find that one cup of this at night is not enough and usually opt for a second. By using a little more than the suggested 1.5 tsp per 8 ounces of water, your first cup (steep for the suggested 2 minutes) will be delightfully strong, and your second cup (I steep the second one within an hour of the first) will be a bit milder, but still wonderful. The second cup takes a bit longer to steep, around 5-6 minutes, but does not get bitter. The fact that about 2 tsp of this yields two excellent cups makes it an unbeatable value.<br /><br />A few last general observations: this price on amazon is identical to the price in the mall; I paid $18.80 in store for 4 ounces. The salesmen don't seem to want to sell any quantity smaller than that anyway. The sweetener that they suggest (in store at $8 per pound) is german rock sugar. It's not bad, but it seems fancy just for the sake of being expensive. Blue agave, as mentioned by another reviewer, perfectly compliments and enhances the flavor of this tea, if you decide to sweeten it, and is much cheaper. The results you get from strictly following the water temperature and steeping time (175* and 2 minutes) pose a surprising improvement over simply guessing and steeping it in near boiling water. I suggest being precise the first couple times if you're not used to approximating temperature and such.<br /><br />Hopefully this review was as helpful as it was long.

After trying different raw diets, we eventually settled on the Weruva brand of dog food. Our local pet store recommended it to us, and the girl working actually opened up a can and started eating it! It's processed in Thailand, and before that scares anybody, you have to realize that the food processing laws in Thailand are MUCH more strict than in America (read it up online!). They are not allowed to process by-product in their pet food, or use filler product. Weruva definitely does not have any of that--you can actually eat the dog food and it'll taste just like dinner.<br /><br />Our boy has a sensitive stomach and he's a very picky eater. The first night we got him the regular Chicken with Gravy he ate that whole can up. He loved it, and when we tried feeding him anything different he refused. Then we ordered him the Kobe Master flavor and it quickly became one of his favorites. I'd definitely recommend this brand, especially coming from a very concerned dog owner.

490948,B001EC7YNE,ADGEMJREA7KS4,Michael M.,1,1,5,1323302400,Coffee has new meaning for me,"I bought the Bosch Tassimo T-Disc single cup coffee and beverage maker (chocolate, teas, etc.) I am so pleased with this system. And I LOVE the Tassimo Gevalia Latte pods (T-Discs).<br /><br />What I like best:<br /><br />-- There's two discs used for each cup of coffee (latte), one is the REAL MILK creamer, the other espresso.<br /><br />-- This gives you the option of having an espresso ONLY, should you choose. Simply don't use the included creamer disc.<br /><br />-- The strength of the espresso or milk is separately adjustable. Simply hold the big, shiny button when the green light is flashing (flashes after the initial brew) and the unit adds more steamed water to the espresso and/or the milk.<br /><br />-- The milk in this latte pack is real milk, not powdered crud like other machines use! IMO it imparts a better, more genuine coffee house flavor to the latte.(Bonus Tip: The milk has been pasteurized at extremely high temperature. That gives it a longer shelf life, but still only about six to 10 months - do NOT refrigerate or freeze. So if you buy these off of eBay or here, ask the seller the date code on the side of ANY package containing dairy (hot chocolate, creamer discs, etc.) since you do not want to get a package close to the shelf life expiration or worse, with expired dates.<br /><br />-- If you want a latte quick, you can be sipping a just-right (not too hot, not lukewarm) in about two minutes from adding the first disc. To avoid fisticuffs on who goes first in the morning or in the break room, there is a dual coffee maker that brews two cups, side by side.<br /><br />-- Unlike other machines, the Bosch Tassimo machine(formerly made by Braun) has a bar code reader that reads the bar code on the label on each disc. The machine reads the bar code and knows what it is supposed to do in terms of how much water to add, how long to heat, etc. How cool is that! Very! For example, if you insert a 12 oz. coffee T-disc, the machine automatically knows to add 12 ounces of hot water to the brewed coffee. If you insert an espresso disc (which comes in this latte package) the machine adds just the right amount of water to make an espresso like you would find in an Italian cafe (about three tablespoons of water). If you need to wake up in the morning have an espresso, you will be gritting your teeth, driving 80 mph in the car to work).<br /><br />-- COFFEE FLAVOR IS EXTREMELY SUBJECTIVE. One man's elixir of the Gods is to another Satan's poison. So these coffees are like romantic relationships. Only you know what you see in someone and you are not going to base a relationship on what friends, family or co-workers think of your significant other. Same goes for coffee. Why on earth would you buy coffee, or not, based on what a total stranger (that's me) thinks tastes good. You need to make up your own mind on what tastes good to you.<br /><br />So what I recommend is that you buy a sampler and find out what you like. After that, then buy packs containing 8 to 14 cups of brew. (Because I like a lot of Half/Half in my way-too-strong coffee shop coffee, I ended up loving these Gevalia Latte T-Discs (but I also happen to like Gevalia coffee). You may like the Maxwell House coffee or the Gevalia Morning Roast blend (I find the Gevalia Morning Roast way too strong for my tastes. I found that with the 12 oz T-Disc I was cutting the 12 oz brewed coffee in half and adding 4 ounces of Half & Half like I had been doing at Starbucks, for example. So that coffee is NOT for me.)<br /><br />-- These individual coffee machines are the rage for making coffee. It is great in the office break room, or for couples who want fresh cups of coffee each morning but not a full or partial pot (making a partial pot is a hassle). I predict that all other coffee makers, except for making big pots for four to ten people, will fall by the wayside. Even with large groups I predict most people are going to want a coffee made to order.<br /><br />-- It is also a fantastic way to save money. Each cup of coffee costs less than a dollar, on average. That's far less than paying $3 to $5 at Starbucks.<br /><br />Bonus Info:<br /><br />-- The package indicates the product is made by Kraft Foods. IMO that's a name you can trust and it will back up the product.<br /><br />-- Do NOT refrigerate, do NOT freeze (the creamer disc will explode rendering them unusable).<br /><br />-- The date code (expiration date) for the creamers (that are a real dairy product, not powered MRE cr#p) is clearly displayed on the side of the package. On mine just bought on 12/02/11 the date code is Aug 05, 2012.<br /><br />-- You can also lose weight with these machines? How is that? Well I don't know about you, but when I used to get my morning and afternoon cup of coffee at Starbucks I would also cave and get a sweet roll of some type. So by not going to the cafe I cut out the temptation (and eventual desire) to get a lemon bar or carrot cake. Cutting out two sweets a day, that has to result in significant weight loss.<br /><br />-- These are cheaper online than, for example, at my local supermarket. For an Eight Latte pack (8 espresso, 8 creamers) I paid $12.99 at my local Safeway. Of course at Safeway I had the latte pack in hand immediately, no waiting for shipping. So for me in an emergency Safeway will do albeit that significantly increases the PPCOC.<br /><br />Sidenote: These machines are a win win. The coffee machine manufacturers and producers make a lot more money because these discs give us far less coffee (per pound if you want to use that measure). But we win because of convenience, weight loss, and also saving money by not spending $10 daily at the cafe (coffee and a sweet). Even a coffee by itself cost about $3 to $5 here in San Francisco, so cutting that expense is significant.<br /><br />Office managers, this is a reason to get one of these types of machines. And arguably productivity will go up since employees won't be leaving the office to get a coffee. And making a coffee with one of these machines is fun. So it might even boost morale (the first few months will be trying because you will have to determine which T-Discs people want. There might be fights if two employees argue over who gets the last latte in the pack.",bought bosch tassimo tdisc single cup coffee beverage maker chocolate teas etc pleased system love tassimo gevalia latte pods tdiscsbr br like bestbr br theres two discs used cup coffee latte one real milk creamer espressobr br gives option espresso choose simply dont use included creamer discbr br strength espresso milk separately adjustable simply hold big shiny button green light flashing flashes initial brew unit adds steamed water espresso andor milkbr br milk latte pack real milk powdered crud like machines use imo imparts better genuine coffee house flavor lattebonus tip milk pasteurized extremely high temperature gives longer shelf life still six months refrigerate freeze buy ebay ask seller date code side package containing dairy hot chocolate creamer discs etc since want get package close shelf life expiration worse expired datesbr br want latte quick sipping justright hot lukewarm two minutes adding first disc avoid fisticuffs goes first morning break room dual coffee maker brews two cups side sidebr br unlike machines bosch tassimo machineformerly made braun bar code reader reads bar code label disc machine reads bar code knows supposed terms much water add long heat etc cool example insert oz coffee tdisc machine automatically knows add ounces hot water brewed coffee insert espresso disc comes latte package machine adds right amount water make espresso like would find italian cafe three tablespoons water need wake morning espresso gritting teeth driving mph car workbr br coffee flavor extremely subjective one mans elixir gods another satans poison coffees like romantic relationships know see someone going base relationship friends family coworkers think significant goes coffee earth would buy coffee based total stranger thats thinks tastes good need make mind tastes good youbr br recommend buy sampler find like buy packs containing cups brew like lot halfhalf waytoostrong coffee shop coffee ended loving gevalia latte tdiscs also happen like gevalia coffee may like maxwell house coffee gevalia morning roast blend find gevalia morning roast way strong tastes found oz tdisc cutting oz brewed coffee half adding ounces half half like starbucks example coffee mebr br individual coffee machines rage making coffee great office break room couples want fresh cups coffee morning full partial pot making partial pot hassle predict coffee makers except making big pots four ten people fall wayside even large groups predict people going want coffee made orderbr br also fantastic way save money cup coffee costs less dollar average thats far less paying starbucksbr br bonus infobr br package indicates product made kraft foods imo thats name trust back productbr br refrigerate freeze creamer disc explode rendering unusablebr br date code expiration date creamers real dairy product powered mre crp clearly displayed side package mine bought date code aug br br also lose weight machines well dont know used get morning afternoon cup coffee starbucks would also cave get sweet roll type going cafe cut temptation eventual desire get lemon bar carrot cake cutting two sweets day result significant weight lossbr br cheaper online example local supermarket eight latte pack espresso creamers paid local safeway course safeway latte pack hand immediately waiting shipping emergency safeway albeit significantly increases ppcocbr br sidenote machines win win coffee machine manufacturers producers make lot money discs give us far less coffee per pound want use measure win convenience weight loss also saving money spending daily cafe coffee sweet even coffee cost san francisco cutting expense significantbr br office managers reason get one types machines arguably productivity go since employees wont leaving office get coffee making coffee one machines fun might even boost morale first months trying determine tdiscs people want might fights two employees argue gets last latte pack

This licorice spice tea is delicious and I drink it equally happily both with and without soy milk (the licorice gives it a natural sweet flavor).

Mitchell,84,84,5,1247097600,Wonderful for both cooking and for health,"The turmeric arrived much faster than expected, and the quality was far superior than expected.<br /><br />I have used turmeric in my cooking for many years, both for Indian-inspired dishes and also for the coloring effects it adds to certain dishes or components of dishes.<br /><br />A few month ago, my mother got me into taking turmeric for the health benefits.  She was having extreme respiratory issues and problems with severe arthritis.  She had several traditional medical treatments and nothing seemed to be working.  After she did a bunch of research, she found a bunch of information regarding the health benefits of turmeric.  After taking turmeric twice a day for about 8 weeks, she was able to be taken off of oxygen and she no longer has problems with her arthritis.  She is no longer taking any other medications and has no further problems as long as she continues to take her turmeric every day.<br /><br />If you are planning on taking turmeric for the health benefits, I highly recommend you do some research first.  The basics are that you need to take about 1 tsp of turmeric mixed into a liquid that contains a fat (such as whole milk) along with about 1/4 tsp of ground black pepper (the black pepper helps with absorption and the nutrients in the turmeric need the fat because they are fat-soluble and not water-soluble).  Do the research before you begin and don't just take my word for it... there are a lot of very respectable medical institutions currently conducting research on turmeric for treating such things as arthritis, acne, joint pain, pain management, respiratory problems, and even cancer, so you should have no problems finding more information online.<br /><br />I usually just take powdered turmeric in a not-too-revolting mixture recipe that I got from my mother: I mix 1 1/2 tsp of powdered turmeric in a 12oz glass of V8 along with 1 tsp of olive oil, 1/4 tsp of fresh ground pepper, 1 Tbs of raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar, 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper, and 1/4 tsp of granulated garlic.  (all that's missing is the vodka)<br /><br />The bottom line is that this turmeric powder is not only great quality, but it is also very inexpensive and in a much larger volume than you might expect.

Texture-wise, the tea ""leaves"" range from almost half-inch long thin shards of leaves down to 1/16th of an inch sized remnants (I've uploaded a picture so you can see for yourself).  The mishmash of textures makes it difficult to portion out the leaves and results in a lot of the small stuff making its way through the infuser of my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0"">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a> (admittedly, a finer meshed infuser might not have as much of an issue here).

Gigi spends her time under the bed, Sophie is wherever I am. What Sophie eats is actually still TBD. This is Gigi's review.<br /><br />Both of them have been picky eaters.

It came in a clear plastic bag with the pretty red label.  Very colorful corn - lots of dark red with a few kernels of white mixed in.  As some of the other reviewers have said, for a hot air popper, you'll definitely want to tip the popper backward the minute you plug it in or else the air pressure will send kernels flying around your kitchen like schrapnel.  Trust me - you'll be ducking for cover and then finding kernels for the next year or so.  I did not let go of my hot air popper until there was a good amount of popped corn to weigh down the unpopped kernels.  These kernels are noticeably smaller than others you'll see in the grocery store so when they pop, the end result is smaller.  If you have shag carpet, this is probably not a good thing.  The husks are softer and tend to cause less damage to your gums if they get caughtin your teeth, though it won't happen often.  The cost for this little bag is also significantly higher than we'd want to pay again.  Another big con for us is the number of unpopped kernels that remain - probably 1 - 2 dozen per 1/2 cup batch.  For the cost, that's too much.

And, like most other Diabetics, I've tried 'em all... every sugar substitute on the market.<br /><br />DiabetiSweet is THE ONE. It Tastes just like sugar. Leaves No Aftertaste, just like sugar. Cooks and Bakes, just like sugar. And Measures spoon-for-spoon, cup-for-cup, just like sugar.<br /><br />I use it, sparingly, in my coffee and tea, and on my cereal.<br /><br />I use it to make cookies, candy, and ice cream.<br /><br />I use it to make cake, cobblers, pies, and coffeecake.<br /><br />I use it to make rice pudding, jello, chocolate mousse, and cr&egrave;me brulee (baked custard with the broiled, or torched, sugar on top... substituting DiabetiSweet of course).<br /><br />I've put it in my food processor, pulsing it a few times, to get it more finely grained like Superfine Sugar (what is commonly called 'Baker's Sugar').<br /><br />I use it for all the things we know and love that are designated: Sinfully Sweet. And you would not know you're eating something sugar-free.<br /><br />I gave DiabetiSweet FOUR (4) STARS for the simple reason that, if you eat too much of it, you WILL get gas; and I mean hard, rumbling, can't-hold-it-in-at-all gas. Get ready to be hugely embarrassed if you're in public.<br /><br />If you go over the gas limit, you'll then find yourself living in the bathroom for the next 3 hours. Imodium becomes your new best friend.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is the downside of DiabetiSweet. It just runs right thru you. So, you have to play with it to see what your limits are.<br /><br />In my particular case, it goes like this: 2 small scoops of ice cream, I'm fine. 3 scoops, I've got gas. 4 scoops and I've become one with my toilet, *lol*<br /><br />I will not give up my DiabetiSweet because of the possibility of these nuisances. I've just learned what my body can handle, and what it can't.<br /><br />Which, if looked at from another perspective, is a good thing; for no one has any business eating 4 scoops of ice cream, a 1/2 dozen cookies, or more than 1 slice of cake, cobbler, or pie.<br /><br />Just like real sugar's harmful effects (obesity, hypo-hyperglycemia, empty calories, etc etc), DiabetiSweet should be used very judiciously.

Stonestreet,1,1,4,1350172800,"Great coffee, reasonable price, compares well to other brands","I purchased ""San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast"" about 2 ½ weeks ago. Since then I've compared it to ""Green Mountain Nantucket Blend"", alternating between the two with an occasional ""Tully's Italian Roast"" mixed in.<br /><br />My wife prefers the slightly bolder blend of the Tully's; I prefer the Green Mountain. Both of us have found the ""San Francisco Bay, French Roast"" to be a good blend that's robust while not overwhelmingly bitter. It may well become our coffee of choice.<br /><br />Personally, I find the ""Tully's Italian Roast"" and ""Newman's Own Special Blend"" to have a bit of a biting after taste that I don't experience with the ""San Francisco Bay, French Roast"".<br /><br />I have friends who only use K-cups. I've given them samples of the ""San Francisco Bay, French Roast"". Their taste runs more to the bolder coffees. Both of them love the coffee.<br /><br />Several reviewers have commented about the sediment left in the bottom of the cup from the ""San Francisco Bay, French Roast"". I agree with them, there is sediment; it's just like I experience with the ""Tully's Italian Roast"" and ""Newman's Own Special Blend"". That seems to be typical of some of the bolder blends and especially the darker roasts. It may also be that the beans are ground finer on these blends to extract more flavor in the brew cycle.<br /><br />These are not traditional K-Cups but they'll work just as well in your Keurig coffee maker. I actually think I get better water flow through the coffee with this new design. My only complaint is the need to keep them sealed rather than in the carousel where I normally store my K-Cups. The cups are packaged in a very heavy plastic bag, which is properly vented for storing coffee. I cut the top enough to remove one cup at a time, then fold over the top and put a clip on it. We drink enough coffee that the 8-cup bag only lasts a couple of days. It's really not a big deal.<br /><br />Should you try it? Probably.<br /><br />I enjoy good coffee, even more when it's reasonably priced. I'm not a ""coffee snob"" and I'm willing to try new things. For me, the ""San Francisco Bay Coffee"" has been a good experience. I'll probably try some of the other blends as well.

I understand that it is dog food, but a little more time and thought could have gone a long way and not have caused me the pain of what I experienced when the box was opened.  First, the box was the same size as the bag of dog food and had no additional packing.  I'm fairly certain the bag was opened or starting to open prior to being packaged and shipped.  Needless to say, when the package arrived via UPS, I opened it in the garage and the contents of the bag went everywhere.  Half of the bottom of the bag was open.  I lost at least half of the bag.  In addition, I don't know how long the bag was sitting opened.  It's probably not an issue with dry dog food, but you never really know.  All I can say is I wouldn't buy an opened bag of dog food at the pet store.  What I intended as a convenience of having this brand of dog food shipped directly to me, turned into a wasted amount of food and a lot of clean up.  I gave a shipping review to Amazon last week, but there was never any ""I am sorry for your inconvenience"" or any other type of apology.

265188,B000EH4XYI,A2D16Q29G5S0E9,"Jim ""highaltitudelowopening""",2,4,5,1217721600,Best Rice Hand Down,"I apologize in advance for being so enthusiastic. After you try this rice you will understand and appreciate where I am coming from. This is far and away the best rice I have ever had. This rice will totally spoil you. It is unlike any other rice you have ever had. All other rice is just rice. Come to think if it, all other rice just impersonates rice, and miserably. This the supreme king of rice. No other rice is like this rice. Cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me. I have been eating it for years. Over ten at least. It is a bit pricy, but well worth it. It has a delicious, delicate and mild, but nutty like flavor that makes you just want to eat more. You'll feel like you don't even need anything else. Garnish it with something if you must. And you will want to eat it all the time. So prepare yourself. You can easily get carried away with this stuff. Even better, it has an absolutely wonderful, aromatic smell that is really a unique joy and will stimulate your desire eat it. In fact, you will probably want to cook it just to smell it in your kitchen after the first time. Then you will want to have your friends, neighbors and relatives over so they can experience it, smell it, taste it! I know I did. After your first experience you will become a Texmati Rice evangelist and want to tell everyone, and make it for everyone you know or at least get them some if they don't get their own so they won't experience life in such a state of depravation by not knowing RICE. I could not believe the wonderful smell of my kitchen when I cooked it. I said what is that. I have to do this again and often just for that effect. I have told many people about this rice and usually mention it at the check out counter, about how superb it is and that it is the best rice I have ever tasted. Cook up a cup or two and it makes the kitchen smell wonderful, just like it tastes. People will comment. I don't eat it all the time, but I would if I could. I wish I could buy it in twenty, fifty, or 100 pound bags. I would. I eat a pretty standard American diet. I like (long, brown and white) rice, but I don't eat rice all the time. This is an excellent product you can buy on faith. This is perfected rice made perfect. I see little way to improve rice over this. Easy to make in rice cooker or microwave or stove top pot. Just follow directions for perfect rice. This is THE rice to serve when entertaining. The organic variety is good too, almost as good, but I think the plain white had a slight edge over it. You might not notice, though, unless you compared. I like them both. I like these better then the other varieties. The brown is good but does not have the same described qualities of taste and smell. It beats any other Jasmine or Basmati rice on the market. Other Basmati's just don't stand up as tall. The flavor is not there. And why would you want to eat sticky rice unless you have no taste buds or are from Asia and grew up on the stuff, in which case I understand. If you favor very bland rice or have very delicate Asian taste buds then ok. You don't need soy sauce on this rice. In fact that would be a barbaric act for sure, but go ahead if you must. This is rice to taste for its own sake. This is THE RICE. Everything else is just rice substitute, ersatz rice, after this rice. I have found nothing that compares, even a close second on the market. Since this is a patented hybrid, I doubt I will. Get it! Try it! Enjoy! Don't wait. You won't regret it. P.S., in the Army we had a really great LRRP meal called 'Beef with Rice and Onions'. It was a freeze dried thing and very hard to come by. Mountain House I think was the contractor. It beat all C's by ten klicks. The freeze dried short white rice in it did not compare, but this is one of my favorite things to recreate with this rice. I have an incredible tri-tip recipe and this rice is just the ticket to go with it. BTW - my votes: best regular soy sauce - Kimlan by far.

I always have milk chocolate and dark chocolate, sometimes white chocolate. I bought this because I have tried a bunch of the Lindt flavors and sent them to my pen pal overseas. Yes, people in this day and age still have pen pals! I was explaining in one of my letters that our grocery store has a span of 5 to 6 Lindt bars in various flavors at all times. She asked me what I was talking about because chocolate comes in milk and dark where she lives. So... I bought up what my grocery store had then sent it off to Northern Europe. My pen pal's family loved trying the various flavors.<br /><br />So... when my local grocery store ran out of ""new"" flavors to send I came to Amazon for help. I put this in my cart, along with every other unusual chocolate flavor I could find (from Lindt and others). When each box of 12 arrived I shared a few bars with the office staff and sent a few bars to my pen pal. This box of chocolate bars DISAPPEARED right before my eyes! I think I sent 3 bars to Europe and the remaining bars were devoured at work. Any buyer of chocolate for an office crew KNOWS when the chocolate is way above par because the pleading eyes come from every corner of the building to grovel for more chocolate.<br /><br />I would buy this again, and again, and again.

So it could be all potato and not meat. Anyway... In an ideal world I would be cooking for my dogs, but I just don't have the time or the freezer space for that. After much research, trial and error, I've found Merrick's Whole Earth Farms Adult Chunky Loaf Dog Food, to have quality ingredients for a really decent price. While there's a slightly higher proportion of carbs from carrots, sweet potato and peas and a little less in protein, its a good place to start. My dogs love it, it smells good and I rotate this every other day with a higher quality feed <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CFR4S"">Instinct Grain-Free Lamb Formula Canned Dog Food by Nature's Variety, 13.2-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> to keep my costs down. This line of feed from Merrick is made with high quality ingredients and even though I leave kibble out all day, my pups dance around the bowl at dinner time to get this canned food.  What's nice is that since they don't use grain or too many carbs, my dogs get good nutrition and their stool (yeah it gross but that's a factor in buying dog food) is more firm, small and less odoriferous. sometimes when changing food, you must introduce the new brand slowly so that their system can adjust. My allergy girl is doing well and I only have to treat seasonally when its really bad outside.  If you'd like some help to determine if the food you buy is really good for your dog, I've found www(dot)DogFoodAdvisor(dot)com to be the best place for reviews of both wet and dry dog food. I may not agree with everything they say, but its a wonderful place to start. I know that your 4-legged friend will do well with this brand.

I maintain, quality in will result in fewer illnesses and vet bills. My dogs usually eat Innova or Fromm.I rarely go to the vet for anything other than wellnes visits and shots. He thinks that the cheapest is fine. His dogs always have ear infections and are a bit on the pudgy side.<br /><br />Enter Beneful.  My brother thinks it is a high quality food brimming with meat and vegetables.  I was not so sure.  If you look at the bag, it would seem he was right but the ingredient list tells another story.  The primary ingredients are ground yellow corn, chicken by product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour and beef tallow.  Yes there is some real beef and much further down the list are carrots and peas. Not exactly the appetizing mix pictured on the bag.<br /><br />The kibble itself has a pleasing appearance.  With no discernible odor, it comes in a variety of shapes colors and textures.  The dogs love it, which is probably not a resounding endorsement as one of them will reguarly clean the cats litterbox if you are not careful.  But in fairness, they do gobble it with great enthusiasm and even try to open the bag to get seconds.<br /><br />The bag is one of the best things about this food.  It has a plastic slide zip which not only works smoothly but keeps the food fresh and safe from maruading pooches.  It is bright and colorful and the 15.5 pound size  is easy to handle.<br /><br />I guess in someways it is like letting your kids go to McDonald's.  An occasional meal won't kill them, but it is not good for everyday.  I will go back to my expensive premiums and use the remaining kibble as training bits.  My brother however, thinks it is great because all the dogs dive into it with unbridled enthusiasm and it is significantly less expensive.  For what it is worth I have a one year old Geraman shepherd and two 3 year old Chinese Cresteds.  He has a 6 year old shepherd, an 18 yr old schnoodle and a three year old chow mix.<br /><br />If you are concerned with convenience the packaging makes this product ideal.

311015,B001EO6FPU,A1EJ6J6N9I7W35,Billy Hollis,2,2,4,1334534400,Best sweetener I've found for weight management,"I used Splenda for a long time to keep sugar out of my diet, but decided to try this as an experiment. I like it better. While the taste is a bit inferior, I seem to be able to use less of it, and it doesn't seem as likely to trigger cravings for more food later. Some of the more recent research says that this is the Achilles heel of sweeteners - using them may save calories immediately, but makes you want to consume more later. In my own case, ZSweet (containing erythritol) does that less than Splenda (sucralose). (Of course, everyone's metabolism is different, so your mileage may vary.)<br /><br />It's way superior to the other sugar-alcohol products. With erythritol, I've never noticed the digestive side effects that maltitol and sorbitol cause if you consume any significant amount.<br /><br />In addition to cooking, coffee, mixing in shakes, etc., I also use this when I want a bit of chocolate. Here's my trick: I get dark, dark chocolate (85-90% cocoa), which has only a very small amount of sugar - typically about 4 grams per serving. Then I put a little bit of this ZSweet powder in a saucer, and dip the chocolate in it for a dusting before taking a bite. That allows me to eat high quality chocolate, and to get some decent sweetness, without the sugar and without the side effect of sugar alcohols in most sugar-free chocolate.<br /><br />*** Update 3 June 2012 ***<br /><br />After using up my first batch, I ordered another. This one isn't the same. The product is coarser, and does not dissolve nearly as well. In cold drinks, it pools at the bottom unless I vigorously stir and shake.<br /><br />Also, one of the two packages had a defect and leaked at the bottom. I thought I was just pouring wrong until I found the leak, after sweeping up a couple of times.<br /><br />So I subtracted a star from my previous enthusiastic review. We'll see on the next batch if they fix these problems. If not, I might have to look elsewhere for erythritol.",used splenda long time keep sugar diet decided try experiment like better taste bit inferior seem able use less doesnt seem likely trigger cravings food later recent research says achilles heel sweeteners using may save calories immediately makes want consume later case zsweet containing erythritol less splenda sucralose course everyones metabolism different mileage may varybr br way superior sugaralcohol products erythritol ive never noticed digestive side effects maltitol sorbitol cause consume significant amountbr br addition cooking coffee mixing shakes etc also use want bit chocolate heres trick get dark dark chocolate cocoa small amount sugar typically grams per serving put little bit zsweet powder saucer dip chocolate dusting taking bite allows eat high quality chocolate get decent sweetness without sugar without side effect sugar alcohols sugarfree chocolatebr br update june br br using first batch ordered another one isnt product coarser dissolve nearly well cold drinks pools bottom unless vigorously stir shakebr br also one two packages defect leaked bottom thought pouring wrong found leak sweeping couple timesbr br subtracted star previous enthusiastic review well see next batch fix problems might look elsewhere erythritol

It takes the ordinary concept of bottled water a few steps further by adding calcium chloride, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulphate, and sodium bicarbonate. It then elevates the PH for better digestion and the reverse osmosis and purification via micro- filtration help make for the cleanest possible taste.<br /><br />We have all heard recommendations from experts that bottled water is a bunch of hype and not worth the money and for the most part I agree with this assessment. The majority of bottled waters on the market are nothing special and not worth the expenditure. But there are some bottled waters that are enhanced in ways that make them better and Essentia is one of them. The added minerals and improved processes help elevate this water to a level not matched by most bottled water products. The higher PH makes the product more alkaline and this suits someone like me very well, since I sometimes suffer from acid reflux. After a heavy meal, my stomach actually feels better if I drink this water.<br /><br />As for the taste, I find it very smooth and clean- the way water should taste. I have taste-tested this, side by side, against the water that comes out of my water filter pitcher and I can say that, while both taste good, this product is a little cleaner and smoother in flavor. It does cost more than the water out of my water filtered pitcher, but the taste is a little bit better.<br /><br />Essentia is packaged in BPA free plastic bottles and it is made with environmental concerns in mind.

I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. I started mixing this food and BJ developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case.  I started the ""at home remedy"" of pepto bismol and a bland diet.  The pet store clerk recommended some canned pumpkin as well.  BJ fasted for 24 hours.  After feeding him boiled chicken & rice for a few days, the blood gradually disappeared. I slowly started mixing the Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. All i can say is BJ is feeling 100% better and his stool is solid!!!  This was the result I wanted with Wellness, but I was very disappointed.<br /><br />IF YOU WANT A HEALTHY PET AND A FEW BUCKS SAVED FROM A VET VISIT, PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS FOOD!",first time owner read best feed puppy higher quality foods instead big commercial brands reading lot positive reviews decided try wellness super puppies worst mistake ever made little bullys stool never firm however make coat shiny developed bad case diarrhea stopped eating drinking day worried lil guy overnight stay expensive vet bill lil bully returned home full energy vet recommened would eat canned purina en rest life realizing really wanted money decided switch food decided go canadae als transition blackjack still loose stool research finally decided cal natural lamb rice started mixing food bj developed bad bloody diarrhea case started home remedy pepto bismol bland diet pet store clerk recommended canned pumpkin well bj fasted hours feeding boiled chicken rice days blood gradually disappeared slowly started mixing cal natural lamb rice say bj feeling better stool solid result wanted wellness disappointedbr br want healthy pet bucks saved vet visit please stay away food

It's hard to see at first, but the front of the bag has a pull-tab, which opens a U-shaped hole on the front, and which can be re-sealed.<br /><br />The cookies are truly bite-sized, being roughly the size of a quarter.  The chocolate chips are hard to discern and, as might be expected in that case, they don't contribute much to the flavor.  Depending on the particular cookie, you may detect no chocolate flavor, or a slight hint of chocolate.  Otherwise, these have the classic old-school shortbread flavor, and are the type of shortbread that is on the firmer side, rather than being very crumbly.<br /><br />One plus is that the calorie count is low for cookies.  Well, I don't really know that much about the calories of cookies on the market; but 7 of these cookies (1 serving) is 130 calories.  Since the cookies are rich, 7 is plenty, and that sounds like a low calorie count to me.<br /><br />I don't think I would bother buying these again because for chocolate chip cookies, I want a different sort of thing.

I therefore think that there may have been something wrong with the first two bags.  In the third pack, most of the cookies did actually contain visible chocolate chips, and more of them.

And the macadamias -- well, it's hard to say.  They are either using very small macadamias or only pieces of macadamias because the pieces are small.  That means, unlike the ones I have had in the past, the chocolate coating is a much higher percentage of the whole and, in fact, there isn't much macadamia flavor there at all, just the crunch.  I struggled hard with how to rate them.  On the one hand, it is hard to find fault with something for tasting like good chocolate but, besides the fact that there should be more, the price is a lot higher than it would be for just chocolate.  I did find that if one allows the chocolate to melt in one's mouth until the nut is pretty much bare, one can enjoy both flavors but it really needs a much higher nut-to-chocolate ratio.

This may be caused by the pain of gum disease or broken teeth, decreased senses of smell or taste, and kibble too hard or too big for older mouths to chew. Pedigree does a great service to our aging canine population by formulating foods that appeal to the older dog; the kibble is easier to chew and appears to have a yummy smell to the dog. My 12 year old chow girl was just not eating and seemed sad. Cham seemed to be on a physical decline. I have used other Pedigree foods for decades and decided to try this senior dog food. She began eating a little more at each meal. Her coat shine has returned and her eyes twinkle once more. She has resumed barking at passing strangers-a sound that I was actually happy to hear again. She is definitely showing the benefits of good nutrition and I hope she will remain in good happy health for several more years.",one problems senior dogs often face decreasing appetite may caused pain gum disease broken teeth decreased senses smell taste kibble hard big older mouths chew pedigree great service aging canine population formulating foods appeal older dog kibble easier chew appears yummy smell dog year old chow girl eating seemed sad cham seemed physical decline used pedigree foods decades decided try senior dog food began eating little meal coat shine returned eyes twinkle resumed barking passing strangersa sound actually happy hear definitely showing benefits good nutrition hope remain good happy health several years

Unhappy with my vet's suggestion to simply walk her more (she already gets 3 walks a day!)  I did my own research and spoke with a pet nutritionist (expensive but worth it). Well little did I realize that this food contains tons of fillers and inferior by-products! Main ingredients include pork by-products and corn grits! The nutritionist recommended that I switch her to a home cooked diet with supplements (multi-vitamin) and urinary health vitamins (cranberry, hydrangea, etc.) to prevent bladder stones and continue to have her urine checked at the vet on a regular basis. Two years later, she's lost the weight and has had no more stones! She also has more energy! Most of the time I cook for her and other times I give her Merrick canned dog food with her urinary vitamins.  I'm not saying this will work for everyone, but it certainly worked for my dog and I'm glad I didn't just accept this food as her fate and deal with the other health consequences that come along with being overweight. I would recommend that anyone with a dog who has issues with bladder stones to do their research and seek a second opinion about ways to deal with these health problems.

I had to wrap it in cheese or something, and she usually spit it out once or twice before it went down.

Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of ""Brian Amazon"" a long time ago.

Smith,1,1,3,1290470400,Tastes like strawberry chalk,"I bought this 24-Count box of Extreme Berries over six months ago to liven up bottled water for my long stays on campus. I didn't really consider the purported health benefits and I think I snagged them when they were discounted. The first time I mixed some up I noted the taste was unusual in some way but also picked up on its ""natural"" flavoring. I'm not implying it's not naturally flavored, but that the flavor tasted natural, which is a good thing. Even at a discount they weren't exactly cheap either so I really wanted to like them. But 6 months later I have more than half left and I rarely finish them once I've mixed them up. I typically get through about 3/4ths of it and then I can't really stand the taste anymore. Now part of the problem is they may have aged and the ingredients may have deteriorated without the demonized preservatives I presume they excluded. But now it tastes, if it didn't always, like strawberry chalk. If it was the only sweet thing I ever allowed myself to have, it probably would taste pretty good. But now it kind of tastes like a bunch of ground up sweet tarts suspended in water without the sugar. Now that I've picked out this chalkiness it seems very distinct and I just can't enjoy it anymore. Now considering all the good stuff its supposed to have in it, and the ingredient list does seem to impress, it's important to be fair. This is a health food (dietary supplement as it says on the box) and that wasn't really what I was looking for. It's not the worst tasting of that kind of product I've ever had and all I can really say is that in that regard it meets expectations.<br /><br />Note that it is sweetened with stevia if that interests you. Really this is all about the antioxidant blend. I don't know what competition is out there but I can say the other means of imbibing the antioxidants in this seem to me like a far less palatable endeavor.",bought count box extreme berries six months ago liven bottled water long stays campus didnt really consider purported health benefits think snagged discounted first time mixed noted taste unusual way also picked natural flavoring im implying naturally flavored flavor tasted natural good thing even discount werent exactly cheap either really wanted like months later half left rarely finish ive mixed typically get ths cant really stand taste anymore part problem may aged ingredients may deteriorated without demonized preservatives presume excluded tastes didnt always like strawberry chalk sweet thing ever allowed probably would taste pretty good kind tastes like bunch ground sweet tarts suspended water without sugar ive picked chalkiness seems distinct cant enjoy anymore considering good stuff supposed ingredient list seem impress important fair health food dietary supplement says box wasnt really looking worst tasting kind product ive ever really say regard meets expectationsbr br note sweetened stevia interests really antioxidant blend dont know competition say means imbibing antioxidants seem like far less palatable endeavor

After reading the glowing reviews, I saved it in my cart for a future purchase, but never ordered it.  Fast forward to yesterday, when I was looking for non-dairy dessert options for my family and saw the priced dropped a couple dollars.  However, there were so many 1 stars for the new formula, I decided to purchase one jar at Whole Foods to try it (at $10 a jar btw).  I do love Nutella, which is like eating decadent candy from a jar.  This isn't as creamy or quite as sweet, but definitely has a similar enough taste to satisfy me, and is much healthier.  I can only imagine how wonderful the original recipe was, and wish I had tried it earlier!  But this one is still good, so I don't understand the bad reviews.  I can clearly taste the hazelnut, not the almonds.  And I specifically paid attention to the salt level.  I have a moderate salt intake (not low, but I'm not a salt-aholic).  It did not taste salty to me, although I'll admit I tasted a tad bit of salt on my lips a few minutes later.  It didn't bother me though.  It has only 65mg sodium (less than half what peanut butter has), so if you can tolerate the salt in Jif, this is significantly less.  It has 12g carbs for those of you wondering, 3 of which are fiber and 7 sugars.  4g protein, and 15g fat.  180 calories total.  No partially hydrogenated oils.

Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're ""probably"" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a ""tomato"" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like ""Tomato and Basil"" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.

They are doing a lot of things right.  The coffee is fair trade and organic certified, roasted in small batches, and the company has started a non-profit organization ""kicks for a cause,"" a group which engages children in soccer to contribute to a healthy lifestyle.  Personally I do not really go for using the name of someone who is unable to choose whether or not they would endorse the product, but that said, their hearts and conscience seem to be in the right place.  The coffee, however (in my opinion) is not very good.  I am saying this as a huge fan of African coffees (my personal favorite) and as one who goes well out of her way to procure same (since it is scarce in the Hawaiian islands, and expensive to bring in).  I have reviewed several other yirgacheffes which I have purchased here.  I would say that this particular brand is among the worst: bitter and completely lacking in the distinctive notes for which yirgacheffe is known.

What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends.

Don't leave this world without Him...<br /><br />Gift of God<br /><br />With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news.<br /><br />It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world.<br /><br />Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God.<br /><br />The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God.<br /><br />The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction.<br /><br />Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc.<br /><br />The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever?<br /><br />Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God.<br /><br />God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven?<br /><br />My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight!<br /><br />It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him!<br /><br />Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death.<br /><br />Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ!<br /><br />Yahushua loves you!",ingredients healthy unfortunately im unable review flavor forgot cant beef anymore due health issuesbr br ingredients beef flavoring supplement salt dextrose corn syrup solids maltodextrin spices spice extractives soybean oil vinegar brown sugar liquid smoke salt black pepper garlic powder spicesbr br info found internetbr br maltodextrin maltodextrin corn soy unsafepoison anyone gmo products like corn soy genetically engineered monsanto company insert bacteria gmo products changes natural organic developing corn soy buy anything contains maltodextrin titanium healthbr br maltodextrin made us made cornbr corn us gmo food maltodextrin derived gmo extremely unsafebr br soy particular info frombr br br br fermented soy products natto tempeh miso soy sauce enjoying health benefits fermented soy wreak havoc body like unfermented soy products dobr br sampling health effects linked unfermented soy consumptionbr br breast cancerbr brain damagebr infant abnormalitiesbr thyroid disordersbr kidney stonesbr immune system impairmentbr severe potentially fatal food allergiesbr impaired fertilitybr danger pregnancy nursingbr br br br jesus christ yahushua hamashiach coming back dont leave world without himbr br gift godbr br bad going world god wants us tell everyone good newsbr br fascinating always watching everything unfold like bible predicts often sent emails saying forward everyone list ashamed yahweh god messiah yahushua hamashiach jesus christ forward emails cuz dont trust im computer literate either sending everyone list along everyone else god command us matter consequence us share good news every one messiah providing us good way worldbr br yep like says going happen holy bible matter version chosen believed believed gonna get beyond tragically ugly think theres bad stuff already happening aint seen nothin yet pretty much remember correctly bible god unleashes plagues likes world never seen see remember sodom gomorrah noahs ark great flood etc etc god abhors sin guilty matter big small even little white lie sin sin god penalty sin eternal death separation godbr br bible also tells mark beast coming world leader antichrist force everyone take either right hand forehead dont take mark die thing going die take mark though damned eternally hell without godbr br good news god loves us much provided way us eternally heaven instead eternally dead sins choose believe repent turn back god receive follow command request accept holy blood covering sins yahushua ha mashiach jesus christ allowed join new heaven new earth god says replace destroyed tribulation period utter horrible death destructionbr br whether believe god heaven hell believe going die like believe need air breath even cant see air along jump tall building fall cuz gravity also cant see etc etcbr br question die god repented received followed sin covering god provided us perfect shed blood sacrifice messiah yahushua beat death hell rose thus shed blood covering sins able enter heaven god foreverbr br choice instead reject gods messiah take easy way still live world along accepting mark beast antichrist thats coming already lead war israel god says cannot serve two masters choose live die live die forever without sad people would rather temporary comfort leading eternal torment satan temporary trouble leading eternal freedom blessings godbr br gods word whether choose believe real like proven true continues believe true yesterday today forever like swift terrible justice immeasurable love us provided eticket heaven sacrificed risen yahushua messiah die god without die accept bail yahushua hamashiach paid behalf get satans hell enter heavenbr br prayer ask jesus christ yeshua yahushua messiah heart follow may know gods plan eternal salvation rescue sins eternal separation god hell perfect sinless sacrificial substitute sins yahushua know boundless unconditional love light ultimate peace power strength comfort mercy grace beauty healing hope joy blessings precious sightbr br gods way says holy word holy son yahushua highway straight hell may god mercy us way finding rejecting serving himbr br jesus hope life life deathbr br please take good care shalom may find healing eternal life holy name jesus christbr br yahushua loves

Manufacturers can say anything they want and the burden of proof is on you (the consumer).  In the end, what you choose to feed your dog boils down to whether the dog likes the food, the food's nutritional content and ingredients and the track record of the dog food manufacturer.<br /><br />The 15.5 pound bag is a good size, and there is a zip top for re-sealing the bag.  I kept mine in a large plastic container for additional freshness.  One of the first things I did was review the ingredient list.  This product starts with ground yellow corn (not digestible by dogs), followed by chicken by-product meal.  We all know what chicken-by product is, so I won't go there, but keep in mind that this is ""pet grade"" meat by-product.  Corn gluten and wheat/rice/soy flour are fillers or binders and offer little nutritional value.  Beef tallow preserved with mixed tocopherols is an ingredient used to make dog food palatable to dogs.  It is essentially rendered cow fat, the same kind used to make soap and candles.  I am happy to see beef listed in the ingredients, but unhappy to see sorbitol and sugar.  Tricalcium phosphate is an anti-caking agent that supplies some calcium.  Animal digest is another form of rendered animal tissue for flavoring.  I noted quite a few preservatives in this food as well: sorbic acid, calcium propionate.  There are also a lot of added colors and dl-methionine which is given to dogs to keep the pH of their urine from damaging grass.  Finally, there is an amino acid derivative (Lysine) and some dried vegetables and vitamins thrown in for good measure.  I suppose the addition of these ingredients make the food a source of ""balanced nutrition.""<br /><br />Although my schnauzer would eat most anything, and it would be easy for me to write a review that says how much my dog loved devouring this food, I cannot overlook the ingredients.  The ingredients are low quality, and many or most of them have been linked to one allergy or another.  As for Purina, their track record is also something I would suggest you research.  This product is OK if you aren't concerned with what you feed your dog, or if you are in a situation that prevents you from buying more expensive alternatives.  I would add the gentle suggestion that it may be more cost effective to provide your dog with a better source of nutrition to prevent costly vet bills down the road.  I would recommend going to a pet type store and checking out the alternatives.  You might be surprised that for a few bucks more you can get a dog food with a much better ingredient list.  And if you're like me and the dog is part of the family, you will be better off in the long run.",decided try food part vine program schnauzer manufacturers say anything want burden proof consumer end choose feed dog boils whether dog likes food foods nutritional content ingredients track record dog food manufacturerbr br pound bag good size zip top resealing bag kept mine large plastic container additional freshness one first things review ingredient list product starts ground yellow corn digestible dogs followed chicken byproduct meal know chickenby product wont go keep mind pet grade meat byproduct corn gluten wheatricesoy flour fillers binders offer little nutritional value beef tallow preserved mixed tocopherols ingredient used make dog food palatable dogs essentially rendered cow fat kind used make soap candles happy see beef listed ingredients unhappy see sorbitol sugar tricalcium phosphate anticaking agent supplies calcium animal digest another form rendered animal tissue flavoring noted quite preservatives food well sorbic acid calcium propionate also lot added colors dlmethionine given dogs keep ph urine damaging grass finally amino acid derivative lysine dried vegetables vitamins thrown good measure suppose addition ingredients make food source balanced nutritionbr br although schnauzer would eat anything would easy write review says much dog loved devouring food cannot overlook ingredients ingredients low quality many linked one allergy another purina track record also something would suggest research product ok arent concerned feed dog situation prevents buying expensive alternatives would add gentle suggestion may cost effective provide dog better source nutrition prevent costly vet bills road would recommend going pet type store checking alternatives might surprised bucks get dog food much better ingredient list youre like dog part family better long run

The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow.

They're really nice to have in general, especially when I'm studying or at work. They have one of the best winterfrost (sweeter than peppermint with less mint overkill) flavor of all the mints I've ever tried. It's not an overwhelming amount of mint flavor; it's just right. The mints are easy to chew if you choose to (I definitely do), they're a bit soft so it won't hurt your teeth if you like to chew your mints instead of just licking them. Since I can easily pop a mint every few minutes, it's a good thing each tin has a whopping 50 mints inside.<br /><br />The tin is really cool, this product's only flaw is that it is a metal tin filled with mints so it will make a bit of clanking noise if you're not careful. Not too good if you're at the library or in class. Just be slow with handling the tin and most of the noise can be eliminated. That's basically the ONLY flaw here, in my opinion.<br /><br />I try to buy these mints at Target (usually about 2 tins for $2.49 in the candy isle) or at Walmart (1 tin for like $1.29).

149286,B0019LTJ7O,A3DLX0PRWAUOUA,Kim C. M.,0,0,5,1350345600,Awesome Product...,"MY EXPERIENCE WITH COCONUT:<br />A few things first... I have done extensive research on Coconut oil & the benefits it has on our bodies.  I can tell you that the antiviral benefits it has definitely works. After a couple of days of sleeping a ton, being very sick & calling me at work crying because she couldn't stay awake, I took my daughter (13 y.o. then 17 now) to the doctor & she was diagnosed with Mono. The doctor explained to me that it is part of the Epstein Barr family (cold sores, herpes, etc.) and that there isn't any kind of medicine that can ""cure"" the illness. He explained that she would sleep a lot, that I needed to call her school & tell them what she had & that she would only be there half days for a few months. I was deflated, stressed & couldn't believe there was nothing I could do for her. I had recently read a book that included coconut oil as a way to detox, lose weight, boost metabolism and so many others and had bought some oil to cook with & take daily. I had done a search & read as much as I could about the coconut & remembered reading that it killed the Epstein Barr virus. I went straight to my computer when I got home & did another search & found the article I had read. I decided to give my daughter the oil twice a day to see if it helped her. I called her down & melted the oil in a spoon & had her take it that afternoon & then again later that evening.  The next morning before I left for work I gave her another dose. She called me around lunch time very happy and excited and said she wasn't tired and could stay awake. I remember thinking that the oil was working and was very relieved, but still a bit hesitant.  When I got home to my surprise, she was very excited, wide awake & for the first time since she was sick, was chipper and I could tell she was getting back to her old self. I gave her another dose of the oil that evening & for a few days after and she was all better.  The oil had killed the virus and restored her health.<br /><br />This stuff is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone who has any illness, pain or arthritis type conditions.  My old dog eats some oil, that I cook with, in his food for treatment of possible arthritis in his hip. He has stopped limping & can raise up from a laying/sitting position better than he has in a long time. It is also the first thing he eats in his bowl (I just take about a tablespoon and toss it on top of the dry food). HE LOVES IT!!<br /><br />ABOUT THIS PRODUCT HERE:<br />I have been taking these pills for about 3 weeks now to help raise my metabolism & to help lower my cholesterol.  I haven't been back to the doctor to see how it is working for my cholesterol, but I can say that it has boosted my energy levels more than any other oil or coconut product I have tried yet.  The closest I've come to this level of energy boost was when I drank some homemade coconut milk from a coconut we bought from the store. Also, When I dropped my daughter off at work yesterday, she was exhausted (stayed up late texting or Twittering I would bet)& I handed her one of these pills & told her it would give her energy... As she walked away she stuck it right in her mouth & swallowed it!! When she came home that night I asked her if the pill worked & she said yes!!  From a TEEN mind you!! This is the same child up top there that knows that this stuff works! I highly recommend this product if you are a coconut user and if you're not...

So, it did not take us long to decide to provide a better dog food for our two blue ticked beagles. Since we can not insure that the beef or chickens used in dog food are of the same quality as what we eat, salmon and potatoes are a better choice. Our female has lost 5 pounds from a hefty 40 lbs to 35lbs and has leveled out beautifully. The male has lost 8 pounds and has also leveled out to the vets praise.

But today, I finally got the answers I was looking for including how to tell which cans at the grocery store are BPA free. Muir Glen started transitioning to BPA free cans (for their tomato products only) in September 2010. Their shelf life is 2 1/2 years; therefore, an expiration date after March 2013 should be a BPA free can liner. You can confirm it is BPA free when you open the can because the old BPA liner was white, but the new BPA free liner is a copper color. I did ask General Mills to please label their products BPA free to help us consumers when shopping. I hope that eventually all canned goods will be BPA free. Let me know what you find when shopping.<br /><br />I am so excited to have a BPA free Organic tomato product, yay! Thanks Muir Glen!<br /><br />old review -<br />I love Muir Glen tomato products but sadly I had to give them up due to their can liners containing bisphenol A (BPA). I will not feed anymore BPA to my kids! It makes me sick that I fed them with BPA laden baby bottles before I knew better. We already have enough cancer in our family. I don't know why anyone is surprised that BPA acts like a synthetic estrogen therefore an endocrine disrupter--BPA was ORIGINALLY developed in the 1930s as a synthetic estrogen drug for women. Shortly after it was developed, a new synthetic estrogen drug came out (DES) so BPA fell by the wayside until someone figured out it could be used in plastics and can liners to help make them harder.<br /><br />I wrote to Muir Glen (now owned by General Mills) to see if they have any plans to remove BPA from their cans but they did not respond to me. I would be happy to pay a bit more for jarred tomato products if they can't come up with BPA free cans. Or how about tomatoes in cartons or frozen?<br /><br />Please write to the companies that you buy canned tomatoes from and ask for BPA free products. Let me know if anyone finds BPA free tomato products, such as tomato paste, diced tomatoes, whole tomatoes...by responding to this comment--I will get an email.<br /><br />I have young children and I will not feed them anymore BPA!!!",update heard muir glen started transitioning canned tomato products bpa free cans contacting muir glen general mills kept getting canned pun intended response believe bpa safeblah blah blah today finally got answers looking including tell cans grocery store bpa free muir glen started transitioning bpa free cans tomato products september shelf life years therefore expiration date march bpa free liner confirm bpa free open old bpa liner white new bpa free liner copper color ask general mills please label products bpa free help us consumers shopping hope eventually canned goods bpa free let know find shoppingbr br excited bpa free organic tomato product yay thanks muir glenbr br old review br love muir glen tomato products sadly give due liners containing bisphenol bpa feed anymore bpa kids makes sick fed bpa laden baby bottles knew better already enough cancer family dont know anyone surprised bpa acts like synthetic estrogen therefore endocrine disrupterbpa originally developed synthetic estrogen drug women shortly developed new synthetic estrogen drug came des bpa fell wayside someone figured could used plastics liners help make harderbr br wrote muir glen owned general mills see plans remove bpa cans respond would happy pay bit jarred tomato products cant come bpa free cans tomatoes cartons frozenbr br please write companies buy canned tomatoes ask bpa free products let know anyone finds bpa free tomato products tomato paste diced tomatoes whole tomatoesby responding commenti get emailbr br young children feed anymore bpa

This is a suggestion to Ruth at BBR - you need to change what you call these in your responses - you can't say, ""After all, we're filling these K-Cups with BBR Coffee.""<br /><br />I'm not an engineer (Really, I'm not) but I can tell you that making something look like a K-Cup and not engineering it to work like a K-Cup is a recipe for disaster. My initial thoughts were the adhesive wasn't viscous enough, but it's wayyy more than that. The plastic is not thick or rigid enough to be punctured and rooted at the bottom of the K-Cup basket. Instead, the plastic just bends and re-forms in the basket - one of the reasons the coffee grounds are exploding UPWARD. You'll need a thicker, less bendable material.<br /><br />The foil cap isn't durable enough either, though if you replace the plastic with one that's stiffer, the foil may work. The adhesive should be upgraded to a material that can be heated, cooled, heated, cooled and never lose its qualities. You may of tested these in your office, but imagine materials that have to withstand sitting in the back of a UPS truck in Phoenix for 5 days. And after that must work in the pressure of a K-Cup basket just like a K-Cup. And you need to make sure that before sealing, you have a clean surface. Otherwise, no adhesive will work, and the adhesive is the weakest link among these materials. You do realize that steamy coffee grounds exploding can burn your customers, right? You can probably get an engineering student to intern for free to advise you, or hire an engineer. Thus ends my free advice.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~initial review below~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />My 36-count box of Fuhgeddaboudit just arrived. I opened it up, wanting to brew one in the Keurig post haste. Unfortunately, after reaching in the box, my hand came out with coffee grounds all over it, and a K-Cup that looked like it never should have passed even the least rigorous quality control standards.<br /><br />C'mon, BBR! I want to LOVE your product! The coffee is delicious! I don't know who is responsible for quality control standards and testing, but these K-Cups are sub-par. Even a newb like me can see that the adhesive you're using is just not viscous enough. Surrounding every round label atop the K-Cup is a nice beard of coffee grounds.<br /><br />I like to think I'm not hard to please. I just want a product that doesn't force me to have to sweep or vacuum after taking it out of the box or removing one from the K-Cup carousel.

I'm very glad this product is on the market.,"UPDATE:<br />The company determined that the product I received was defective in some way. They speculated it got too hot during storage or shipping. They replaced it for me at no charge. Everything is good. The replacement food is great.<br /><br />Here's my original review after a little editing, including further details of the resolution:<br /><br />I have been buying the ""Organic Liver for Dogs"" from my local store. The consistency (firmness and uniformity) of the product had been good. So I ordered a case of it from Amazon. When it arrived, I opened two cans immediately, excited to give my dog some more organic beef liver. However, both cans contained small pellets of something (liver?) and water. It was nothing at all like the same product that I have been purchasing locally, even though the label is the same and it is sold as the same product.<br /><br />I wasn't even sure if it was safe to feed it to my dog. The cans from Amazon are simply liquid plus a handful of pellets.<br /><br />As I look through the reviews now, I see there is a consistency problem with Newman's Own Organics pet foods. Some batches appear OK, but some are not edible (even by dogs). I sense a serious quality control problem.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow returns of this product. I opened two cans. Now I have the rest of the case that I'm afraid to feed to my dog. I can shake all the cans and hear that they are all liquid plus pellets (as opposed to the firm liver puree that was in the cans I purchased locally).<br /><br />UPDATE: I wrote the company and they quickly resolved the issue for me by sending me a new order at no cost. The new order has arrived now and the product is fine. It has the proper consistency. It looks exactly like the very good quality dog food that I was used to when I purchased this brand locally. So everything is resolved for me.<br /><br />I give the food itself a 5 star rating. Where else can one find certified organic beef liver for dogs in a convenient form and at a fair price? I think this product is the best available to me at this time, so it has to be rated 5 stars.<br />I give the customer service from Newman's Own Organics a 5 star rating as well.<br />I have a few reservations about quality control, based not only on my own experience, but on what I read in other reviews here. Fortunately, the company will stand behind its product and resolve any issues. Therefore, the lowest rating I could give for quality control would be 3 stars.<br />Overall, I think I would rate the product 4.5 stars. Since the customer service was so outstanding and the product is the best I have found of this type, I'll round up to 5 stars.",updatebr company determined product received defective way speculated got hot storage shipping replaced charge everything good replacement food greatbr br heres original review little editing including details resolutionbr br buying organic liver dogs local store consistency firmness uniformity product good ordered case amazon arrived opened two cans immediately excited give dog organic beef liver however cans contained small pellets something liver water nothing like product purchasing locally even though label sold productbr br wasnt even sure safe feed dog cans amazon simply liquid plus handful pelletsbr br look reviews see consistency problem newmans organics pet foods batches appear ok edible even dogs sense serious quality control problembr br unfortunately amazon doesnt allow returns product opened two cans rest case im afraid feed dog shake cans hear liquid plus pellets opposed firm liver puree cans purchased locallybr br update wrote company quickly resolved issue sending new order cost new order arrived product fine proper consistency looks exactly like good quality dog food used purchased brand locally everything resolved mebr br give food star rating else one find certified organic beef liver dogs convenient form fair price think product best available time rated starsbr give customer service newmans organics star rating wellbr reservations quality control based experience read reviews fortunately company stand behind product resolve issues therefore lowest rating could give quality control would starsbr overall think would rate product stars since customer service outstanding product best found type ill round stars

But, WOW, am I glad I did. This tea has so much more flavor, is so much more delicate and lovely than Stash could ever hope to be. And this is decaf! Remember when you brew green tea - it is best to use water that isn't quite hot enough to boil - that keeps your cup of green tea from getting bitter. (Conversely, black and herbal teas are best made boiling water) Also, do not brew it too long - meaning, don't go longer than the recommended time noted in the box flap - or you'll release more tannins and experience slight bitterness. Personally, I brew mine on the weak side (3 minutes) with not quite boiling water, I add 1/2 tsp of sugar, and milk .... pure heaven in a cup. Lovely fragrance, taste, and aftertaste. Others might say milk overpowers green tea, but I enjoy it. I believe this tea only contains 5 mg of caffeine per cup (decaf is never 100% free of caffeine) so you may drink it at night without worry about staying up all night, or if you doc recommends cutting down on caffeine, or if you simply want to give your tummy a break from irritating caffeine - this is the ticket.

So much for the ""no mess"" aspect.<br /> Squeezing the bottle as suggested by a few only results in a glop of foul-smelling liquid oozing out and dripping on the floor.<br />Yes, I said foul-smelling. I know dogs have a somewhat different take from their people on what smells good and what doesn't, but 3 of our 4 dogs recoiled at the smell of the product. Our only ""outside"" dog would take a lick, then take a sniff of her own rear end...presumably she found the scent similar. If you've ever seen a dog do that, then you know what I mean.<br /><br />I'm also concerned about how sanitary this delivery system is. Between uses you have a ball laden with dog-mouth bacteria multiplying. I doubt rinsing the ball before storage would help much, undoubtably some slobber is going to contaminate the bottle contents during usage. Refrigeration is not suggested on the label but it might help retard bacteria growth between uses.<br /><br />I think this product is another one of those things that sound like a good idea but the execution is flawed.

I've spent significant time researching foods that meet these three categories and one of the select few options I identified was nuts.  Of course, only soy nuts have all of the amino acids to qualify as a complete protein.  Beyond their value as a quality protein source, soy nuts also provide a good balance of carbs, protein, and fat, one of the strongest of any single whole food.  This balance is important to maintaining blood sugar levels and deriving a sated feeling from the food, and it also conforms to various diet plans, i.e., the Zone.  These soy nuts provide all these benefits without even the negative of added salt/sodium.<br /><br />Conclusion - it's worth researching whether substitution of soy nuts, especially on an infrequent schedule, for other types of snack food is right for you.  I happen to think it is.<br /><br />I received this product fairly quickly and it met the description on Amazon.  I'm deducting one star only because the taste of these soy nuts is not quite as good as green soy beans that i've roasted at home myself.

This ingredient, when combined with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) creates Benzene which is carcinogenic (cancer causing).<br /><br />I used to use Splenda or generic sucralose packets, but they made a mess on the counter, took up too much room in our pantry when purchased in bulk, and took up alot of space near the coffee maker when compared with concentrated sweeteners. EZ sweet would be the easy alternative if it weren't toxic. I had to find a better option. I find that the only super easy way around using EZ sweet but also save on space/mess is to use the splenda mini tablets. They are pricey and will cost a lot more than the packets, so I've recently found another option. I can now purchase 1 oz of pure sucralose powder form from the Splendex site and mix it with 3 oz of water to make the equivalent of 2,500 packets of Splenda. The cost of the 1oz powder is only $24.95. I found that other companies sell sucralose powder and if you buy a lot of it, it's even cheaper.

I wanted to make sure that when it was time for her to start soft food she was getting the maximum amount of vitamins and nutrients needed for optimum health.  I was given the Baby Brezza at my baby shower and when my daughter turned 4 months I decided to give it a try. The set up is a breeze and the recipes included were labeled by age, so I knew which ones to make for her based on her age.  I decided to try the carrots and pears first.  From prep to clean up it took all of 20 minutes of my time. I followed the recipe for 1 batch which was 2 carrots and 1 pear and I was able to make 5 jars of food.I felt even better that it was preservative and chemical free and only cost pennies to make as opposed to store bought baby food that can run as much as a $1 per jar.

I have searched and searched for a very tiny kibble which, when water is added, will not take an hour to soften up for them.  All others I have tried are so hard  and larger than I like, except bil-jac.  I have been giving them bil-jac for years mixed with canned dog food.  Bil-jac is the only one I had found that the kibbles are small and easy to crumble for them even dry.  To add water to it, however, makes it more gooey.  I wanted to try something new for them but had just about given up.  I tried this brand of canned dog food and that was a hit so thought I'd give this dry a try.  Well, it works just great and they love it.  I use a  Cuisinart  k-cup type coffee maker that also is used in our household for hot water.  I just put the dog food in a bowl add the hot water and it is soft enough in less than 10 minutes.  It is not as gooey as bil jac when wet. The kibble is triangle shaped about 3/8 of an inch on all sides. VERY TINY, which is what I needed. I would recommend this food to anyone with small dogs, older dogs of any size who have gum and teeth problems and have  trouble chewing or are missing teeth and can't chew at all.

Both have started turning into butterballs from extra treats given during training as well as not enough walks, and could each lose 1-3 pounds. We've stepped up exercise but I still wanted a food that would help maintain their weight because they're both low to the ground and weight gain prone. My bf and I have been searching and searching for the ""right"" food to give them both. The choices and information on dog food is insane and combined with finding food they'll both eat is head spinning!<br /><br />The bigger/older one is super picky about all food and is known to spit out treats he doesnt like and to not even sniff new foods he hasn't experienced until u show him or break it up for him, but the little one will gobble anything in a flash. Previously we've had the oldest on Kirkland brand adult food and while he doesn't ""love"" it, he'll eat it with some waffling and overall its proven to keep him solidly healthy. After getting the 2nd pup who has typical jrt skin sensitivities I started researching foods to help him out and switched him from blue buffalo puppy to blue wilderness (also he stopped growing up and started growing out bc of too much puppy food richness which our older one also experienced when he was transitioning to adult). (As most know small dogs can stop growing much sooner compared to large dogs.) We tried to feed blue wilderness to the older one but found that he definitely turned his nose at it and given half and half portions preferred Kirkland over blue. In general I think blue is an awesome food but tends to be a little too calorie dense for our guys. Combined with their recent chubbiness and based on great reviews and ingredients, I decided to try Wellness Super5mix Healthy Weight for small breeds.<br /><br />We've only just bought some a few days go so I'll have to report back on weightloss, but we were super excited that based on first a small sample to each, then second when we mixed a meal with their old food they both immediately gobbled up the food.

In lieu of not being able to find my go-to Chamomile at the grocery, I reached for Bedtime Story since in the tag line it expressed being Caffeine Free and made with Real Spearmint and Chamomile Flowers. I was curious what the Spearmint would be like with the Chamomile so I scooped Lipton Bedtime Story with plans to make a cup that night.<br /><br />Upon opening the box, I was hit with the tingly scent of Spearmint. I brewed a cup, curiously wondering if the tea would be more minty than I wanted. After letting it steep for a few minutes, I added my favorite accompaniments and sipped. Delicious. It's a soft, relaxing blend of Chamomile. The Spearmint is not overpowering like I had worried it might be. The ingredients listed are Spearmint Leaves, Chamomile Flowers, Peppermint Leaves, Orange Peel, Lemon Grass, Spice, Chicory Root.

I checked out their website, and for those of you who don't know... you want to go for COLD PRESSED oils. If they're not cold pressed, it means they've been processed with major machinery and subjected to high heats, which as anything goes, can and usually does, kill any good minerals and vitamins. Their site posts information on their extraction process. As of today, this is what it states:<br /><br />""""Manila Coco oil extraction method is through a proprietary, state-of-the-art mechanical expeller (Manila VirginFlo), thermo-stable to hold off the lowest moisture possible (0.1%) to avoid rancidity and keep shelf life consistent up to 3 years under normal conditions. Our oils are 1st and 2nd stage press-induced, without chemical solvents, no bleaching, no deodorizing, no hydrogenation, no fermentation enzymes - to keep its natural light sweet coconut aroma and taste. This method sustains its unique character even when subjected to high (up to 170 degrees Celsius) heat temperatures.""""<br /><br />Mechanical Expeller is their form of extraction. And they also say it sustains unique character... blah blah blah... when subjected to high heat temperatures. Therefore, in my personal opinion, it is not as ""unadulterated"" as their information on their products on Amazon make them sound. I will be steering clear of their products.<br /><br />I'm sorry if my review offends some, but if you're going to pay good money for something, you should know about it. I would use different brands before sticking yourself with this one. I was looking for larger quantities, which is why I looked at this product, however I will be sticking with Nutiva. As their coconut oil is cold pressed soon after the coconuts are cut open. The information below is direct from their website.<br /><br />""""What makes Nutiva's virgin coconut oil so special? Much of the magic lies in the way the oil is processed. Within several hours of the coconuts being chopped, the meat is cold-pressed, unlike other varieties of coconut oil which can be left for more than 10 hours before pressing. Nutiva's approach preserves as much of the oil's natural color, flavor and aroma, giving you the best results for any use.""""<br /><br />If you don't care about how it's processed, it is still going to be much healthier than your average grocery store found vegetable and canola oils. If you want to read some scary things, look up the dark information on how those are processed. YUCK! Talk about horrifying.<br /><br />Thank you for your time.<br />-Amy<br /><br />PS. I used to be one of those ""organic? what kind of fruitcake are you? Think you're more special than anybody else?"" people. But I have learned so much in the past year and a half, dealing with my son's allergies and intollerances. There's more to it than ""oh it's more expensive, so it's just making me feel special because I can afford it."" No. There's WAY more to it than that. I urge everybody to talk to people about organic foods. It's a way of life, a healthier way of life. We all deserve to live healthier.

White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is certified organic, and is both fair trade and kosher.<br /><br />It is made from hand-wrapped white tea leaves and rosebuds! Rosebuds---can you imagine?!?! Those are the only two ingredients, and they are delicate and delicious, different from anything else I've ever tried. This Amazon page erroneously lists some other ingredients but these are absolutely NOT in this tea---it is made from only white tea and roses.<br /><br />This tea, like all Numi teas, is packaged with 100% post-consumer waste, and the tea bags are made from biodegradable filter paper. Numi does not believe in the practice of adding oils or flavorings to bolster flavors, and I love this and can tell the difference; for this and many other reasons, Numi is one of my favorite tea manufacturers.<br /><br />On the box, Numi writes: ""Roses have been a symbol of love and beauty since the dawn of romance. Numi's enchanting Velvet Garden(tm) releases a provocative sweet rosy taste as it blushes a soft pink. With every sip this liaison of organic rose petals and delicate Spring White tea imparts a silken smoothness.

I thought surely I could just use a tiny amount and apply it evenly to smooth out my dry ends.<br />So here was my experience; I washed and dried my hair. I put a pea sized amount in my palm and rubbed my hands together to spread it. I then lightly patted my hands over my hair, mostly from about ears down (my hair is shoulder length). I washed the excess off my hands. I combed the oil through my hair and it looked slightly greasy. I then bent forward with head upside down and combed through from nape forward. I combed a lot to spread the oil. It still looked a little greasy. So I waited about a half hour and combed through it again. Still the same amount of slight greasy look, there was Zero absorption of the oil into my hair. It just lays on top.<br />I am used to using moroccan oil for my hair, so I thought this would be similar. No dice! The product I like is the brown bottle with the blue label by Moroccanoil. That product soaks in beautifully and leaves no greasy feel.<br />As far as the smell that others complained about, I did not find it to be too strong or offensive. I thought it was kindof nice. But that is the only redeeming quality to me. I think someone with ethnic hair might really like this product, so that's why I threw in an extra star rather than just giving one.<br />I really think it should say somewhere on the bottle that it works best with ethnic hair!",agree lot reviewers product read thought well maybe theyre using much hair tends toward dryness thought id give try despite comments others thought surely could use tiny amount apply evenly smooth dry endsbr experience washed dried hair put pea sized amount palm rubbed hands together spread lightly patted hands hair mostly ears hair shoulder length washed excess hands combed oil hair looked slightly greasy bent forward head upside combed nape forward combed lot spread oil still looked little greasy waited half hour combed still amount slight greasy look zero absorption oil hair lays topbr used using moroccan oil hair thought would similar dice product like brown bottle blue label moroccanoil product soaks beautifully leaves greasy feelbr far smell others complained find strong offensive thought kindof nice redeeming quality think someone ethnic hair might really like product thats threw extra star rather giving onebr really think say somewhere bottle works best ethnic hair

Wind,187,216,3,1325808000,Why can't anyone make a hot cocoa without sucralose/Splenda in it?,"I HATE SUCRALOSE.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know how other people CAN'T taste it when it's in sweetened products. It's got this unpleasant fake flavor that I just can't ignore. I think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising.<br /><br />That being said, it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, and as such I have to give it higher marks than the competition.<br /><br />Still, I can't believe this product AND its nearest competitor use sucralose but don't say they're a diet, lite, low-sugar, or otherwise unnaturally-sweetened product. It's frustrating. I can taste the stuff, and I really dislike it. I also don't like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but I won't go into that here (just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run).<br /><br />There's one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a K-Cup, and that's Swiss Miss. Unfortunately, the Swiss Miss K-Cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find.<br /><br />My opinion? It's probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your Keurig. It's not worth the K-Cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. Spending more than seventy-five cents per cup of water-based hot cocoa is about the limit for me.<br /><br />So, if you're into sucralose/Splenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not-sugar flavor. If you're like me, though, and can't stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option.<br /><br />Three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. Minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I just found out that the Swiss Miss K-Cups also use sucralose. So really, your only choice is to get packets and use your Keurig as a hot water dispenser. How disappointing.<br /><br />UPDATE 02/12: After some research, I found that there is one K-Cup hot cocoa that doesn't have sucralose; However, it is loaded with fructose instead (not the greatest trade-off, since it tastes different from sugar/sucrose, in my opinion) and has no actual sugar/sucrose in it. That one is Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa. Unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor (probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil) and is on the salty side, so I have avoided it. It's also more expensive per-cup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty-five cents (as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars) then go ahead and try it. I will refrain at this point and stick to using packets.<br /><br />I would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa K-Cups, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K-Cups, and Grove Square Hot Cocoa K-Cups ALL use sucralose. Yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is IN ADDITION TO sucralose/Splenda, and not by itself.<br /><br />So your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. None of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant.<br /><br />43 servings of sugar-sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and it's no more complicated than a K-Cup if you know how to operate a spoon.",hate sucralosebr br honestly dont know people cant taste sweetened products got unpleasant fake flavor cant ignore think company uses junk required law indicate box advertisingbr br said seems like hot cocoa less sucralose cafe escapes hot cocoa give higher marks competitionbr br still cant believe product nearest competitor use sucralose dont say theyre diet lite lowsugar otherwise unnaturallysweetened product frustrating taste stuff really dislike also dont like chemical makeup sucralose wont go believe natural sugar way better long runbr br theres one choice hot cocoa kcup thats swiss miss unfortunately swiss miss kcups ridiculously high priced hard findbr br opinion probably better get favorite hot cocoa packets use hot water function keurig worth kcup convenience put artificial sweeteners significantly higher prices spending seventyfive cents per cup waterbased hot cocoa limit mebr br youre sucralosesplenda means grab enjoy weird aftertaste decidedly notsugar flavor youre like though cant stand artificial stuff avoid product find another optionbr br three stars tasting decent despite awful artificial sweetener minus two stars artificially sweetened mentioning anywherebr br update found swiss miss kcups also use sucralose really choice get packets use keurig hot water dispenser disappointingbr br update research found one kcup hot cocoa doesnt sucralose however loaded fructose instead greatest tradeoff since tastes different sugarsucrose opinion actual sugarsucrose one green mountain coffee hot cocoa unfortunately reviews say strong coconut flavor probably second ingredient coconut oil salty side avoided also expensive percup unless think single cup cocoa worth dollar twentyfive cents opposed box packets around two dollars go ahead try refrain point stick using packetsbr br would also like clarify despite comments say cafe escapes hot cocoa kcups swiss miss hot cocoa kcups grove square hot cocoa kcups use sucralose yes sugar addition sucralosesplenda itselfbr br choices right pure sucralose sucralose plus sugar pure fructose none appetizing make cost per cup cocoa quite unpleasantbr br servings sugarsweetened cocoa canister run around six bucks complicated kcup know operate spoon

Just mineral oil.  So basically, this is mineral oil with a little bit of other oils and scented to smell pretty.  ""Shea"" falls WAAAAAAAAY down on the ingredients list.  Next, be careful about how much of this you use, especially if you put it right on your scalp, to nourish and soothe it, like the label says you can.  Use it like this, and you'll look like you just dipped your head in a French-fryer.  Don't do that!<br /><br />Once I understood these things about this product, though, I like the way it helps take care of my hair when it's dry.  I don't use much, and I make sure I put it more towards the ends of my hair instead of putting this product right on the scalp.  It can help tame flyaways.  Also, if I'm going to wear my hair up or braid it, and it's too clean and slippery to hold a style, I use a little more of this product on the length of my hair- nowhere near the scalp!- and it helps the hair hold the style better than freshly-washed hair does.  And it does add in moisture.<br /><br />Although the scent is pleasant, considering this is basically mineral oil, if it's mineral oil that you're looking for, why not get a much cheaper, much larger bottle of mineral oil, and skip this product?  You'll get the same results, and will have a little extra cash left over.

They have just enough flavor to make me want more, but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.

So many of my friends' dogs are sick with cancer and other diseases.  Whay are they eatting...?  I made the choice will you; or do you like to have your ears tickled?<br /><br />The Painful Truth:<br /><br />You really do get what you pay for when it comes to pet food, as illustrated in Ann N. Martin's book, Food Pets Die For. First published in 1997 and updated in 2003, Martin's book was the first to expose the ingredients legally used by pet food companies, including euthanized cats and dogs, zoo animals, roadkill, and diseased and rotted meat unfit for human consumption. Lest you think that what Martin documented isn't widespread, she writes:<br /><br />""In later investigations in both the US and Canada, I was to learn that the collars, tags, flea collars, and even plastic bags in which (euthanized) pets are wrapped, are not removed before they are shoved in the rendering pit. Deceased pets are being 'recycled' into pet food, and pet owners have no knowledge of what is happening.""<br /><br />* Poultry by-product meal. By-products can include: intestines, chicken heads, duck bills, chicken and turkey feet, feathers and bone, soy, cottonseed hulls, corn cobs, peanut hulls, citrus pulp, screenings, weeds, straw, and cereal by-products. Ingredients listed as beef, chicken and poultry by-products are not required to include actual meat. Rendered meat can be ANY rendered mammal meat, including cats and dogs. If the ingredient contained enough meat that it could be measured, it would be labeled as MEAT.<br />* Digest of chicken by-products. Animal digest is a cooked-down broth made from unspecified parts of unspecified animals. Any kind of animal can be included, and the animals can be obtained from any source, so there is no control over quality or contamination.<br />* Corn gluten meal. Corn gluten is a cheap by-product of human food processing. It offers little nutritional value and serves mainly to bind food together.<br />* Soybean meal. Soybean meal is a poor quality protein filler. The Crude Protein analysis on pet food labels is only a measurement of the amount of nitrogen in a food -- not the quality of the protein. Because of this, pet food companies can use the cheaper by-products of human food production, such as soybean meal, to boost protein numbers.",whatbr br understand buzz words mean become educated informed consumer capable making good choice pet money pouch many friends dogs sick cancer diseases whay eatting made choice like ears tickledbr br painful truthbr br really get pay comes pet food illustrated ann n martins book food pets die first published updated martins book first expose ingredients legally used pet food companies including euthanized cats dogs zoo animals roadkill diseased rotted meat unfit human consumption lest think martin documented isnt widespread writesbr br later investigations us canada learn collars tags flea collars even plastic bags euthanized pets wrapped removed shoved rendering pit deceased pets recycled pet food pet owners knowledge happeningbr br poultry byproduct meal byproducts include intestines chicken heads duck bills chicken turkey feet feathers bone soy cottonseed hulls corn cobs peanut hulls citrus pulp screenings weeds straw cereal byproducts ingredients listed beef chicken poultry byproducts required include actual meat rendered meat rendered mammal meat including cats dogs ingredient contained enough meat could measured would labeled meatbr digest chicken byproducts animal digest cookeddown broth made unspecified parts unspecified animals kind animal included animals obtained source control quality contaminationbr corn gluten meal corn gluten cheap byproduct human food processing offers little nutritional value serves mainly bind food togetherbr soybean meal soybean meal poor quality protein filler crude protein analysis pet food labels measurement amount nitrogen food quality protein pet food companies use cheaper byproducts human food production soybean meal boost protein numbers

As has been mentioned in many other reviews, they don't look like ""normal"" K-cups, but they work in Keurig brewers.  Never had any problems with the brand or the innovative cup design.<br />I also like Amazon's Frustration Free packaging option - between that and the reduced plastic in the cup itself, this is a good less-waste alternative, and the price is great.<br /><br />However - I really don't care for this particular French Roast variety.  I'm not especially picky about coffee - I like a variety of brands, roast styles, and flavors.  Specifically, I tend to prefer ""Dark"" and ""Extra-bold"" K-cups.  But this particular French Roast just doesn't work for me.  Some of the cups have been worse than others, but I find the coffee to be especially bitter, with a very distasteful burned flavor.  With most coffee, I can enjoy it black, but I usually add just a little bit of cream and sugar.  For this variety, I have to add an extra slug of cream, which balance out the bitterness just enough to be ""OK"".  With this amendment, they're not quite bad enough to throw away, but I definitely won't be purchasing more.<br /><br />To summarize: SF Bay K-cups are great - if you stick to the non-French Roast varieties.<br /><br />**Update: After receiving the prompt comment on this review from SFBay's customer service, I gave them a call.  I immediately talked to a real person at the company (not some random call center), who was very helpful and communicated clearly.  This helpful rep was primarily focused on making me happy with their coffee, and to that end, he sent me three replacement bags of different varieties (which I knew I liked) at no cost.  I've tried those and, as usual, they're excellent.  He was also concerned that there might be something wrong with the batch or roast that I had received, and provided me with a pre-paid label to return the old coffee so they could test it.<br />So I'm still not sure whether I got a bad batch, or whether I just don't like this flavor.  Hence my 4/5 stars.  But either way, with customer service of this caliber, it's DEFINITELY worth trying the coffee!  Highly recommended.

109434,B004OVWQDA,A2388VDP6CQOQ7,R. Santor,3,3,5,1336953600,The ONLY Packaged Coconut Water Worth Tasting,"A little while back I was given a box of 12 whole young coconuts to enjoy. After a bit of practice I perfected the art of chopping the top open with a butcher's cleaver to insert a straw and suckle the sweet nectar contained within. As much fun as that was, whole coconuts take up too much space in the fridge and I'm always concerned that they must use some kind of chemicals on them to keep the ""fresh"" from their home in Thailand to my grocer's refrigerators.<br /><br />Without knowing really anything about the whole packaged coconut water game, I assumed very incorrectly that I could just select a container of any random brand off a store shelf and it would taste as immaculate as the perfect juice from a fresh-cracked coconut.<br /><br />I could not have been more wrong.<br /><br />I first tried Vita Coco because it seems to be the most common brand really everywhere. It was even at Costco, so I bought their handy 12-pack expecting to delight in the treat. I got the tetra-pak all nice and chilled before taking my first sip, and when I did I was furious. ""How can they call this coconut water?!"" I exclaimed. It tastes kind of like diluted, sour, used, soapy dish water that leaves a funky wang in your mouth and does nothing toward quenching your thirst. It seemed to make me thirsty for some plain old water. Yuck!<br /><br />At first I thought maybe I got a bad batch, but then I headed online for some reviews and I found I was not alone. How unfortunate. However, I also found lots of reviews of some other brands that people seemed to love. ""Yay! There's still hope!"" I thought to myself.<br /><br />The confusing part was that for every brand for which I found good reviews, there seemed to be countless other reviewers disgusted by each one. I read a review comparing Zico, O.N.E., and Vita Coco to one another, and it ranked the former two far above the latter. I went ahead and bought a bottle of each Zico and O.N.E. and determined they are swill, especially Zico, which tastes like tap water that was spit into by someone who just ate a rotten coconut.<br /><br />I continued reading reviews and found several stating that Amy & Brian is really great, but that some find it overly sweet. I am not a fan of sugary sweetness in my coconut water, but I thought I'd give it a try anyway. The results? Meh. It's really not sweet at all, and although there is more flavor, it still doesn't taste like fresh coconut water. Yet another review stated that Nature Factor was a close second behind Amy & Brian, so I gave that a shot. It's definitely a little worse than Amy & Brian, but it is very similar and doesn't taste like a real coconut.<br /><br />I was just about to give up hope when one of the small ~9 oz. bottles with pulp of Taste Nirvana landed in my hands. I presumed it was going to be more funky wang sauce, but I took my first sip and whoa-ho-hoooo what have we here? A miracle in a bottle? A fresh coconut shaped like a bottle? Nay, it was really bottle coconut water that really tasted like coconut water! In fact it tastes even better than fresh coconut water because there's a subtle sort of butteriness to the flavor. I thought it had to be a fluke, but I took another sip (and about finished the bottle), and every drop went down as unbelievably delicious as the first.<br /><br />I immediately hopped onto Amazon and started a subscribe & save subscription. My first case of these 16 oz. tall cans sans pulp arrived today and after a quick 1 hour in the freezer, I just tried my first can. Son of a biscuit, it almost brings me to tears to tell you this, but it was possibly the best canned beverage I've ever guzzled. I tried so hard to make it last, but I almost chugged the darned thing because the deliciousness was so unstoppable.<br /><br />In short, if you're looking for some good coconut water and don't want to deal with cleaving real coconuts, save yourself a lot of time and heartache; don't try anything but Taste Nirvana. You won't regret it. I just wish I had someone else giving me this advice at the start of my misadventures in coco-hunting.",little back given box whole young coconuts enjoy bit practice perfected art chopping top open butchers cleaver insert straw suckle sweet nectar contained within much fun whole coconuts take much space fridge im always concerned must use kind chemicals keep fresh home thailand grocers refrigeratorsbr br without knowing really anything whole packaged coconut water game assumed incorrectly could select container random brand store shelf would taste immaculate perfect juice freshcracked coconutbr br could wrongbr br first tried vita coco seems common brand really everywhere even costco bought handy pack expecting delight treat got tetrapak nice chilled taking first sip furious call coconut water exclaimed tastes kind like diluted sour used soapy dish water leaves funky wang mouth nothing toward quenching thirst seemed make thirsty plain old water yuckbr br first thought maybe got bad batch headed online reviews found alone unfortunate however also found lots reviews brands people seemed love yay theres still hope thought myselfbr br confusing part every brand found good reviews seemed countless reviewers disgusted one read review comparing zico one vita coco one another ranked former two far latter went ahead bought bottle zico one determined swill especially zico tastes like tap water spit someone ate rotten coconutbr br continued reading reviews found several stating amy brian really great find overly sweet fan sugary sweetness coconut water thought id give try anyway results meh really sweet although flavor still doesnt taste like fresh coconut water yet another review stated nature factor close second behind amy brian gave shot definitely little worse amy brian similar doesnt taste like real coconutbr br give hope one small oz bottles pulp taste nirvana landed hands presumed going funky wang sauce took first sip whoahohoooo miracle bottle fresh coconut shaped like bottle nay really bottle coconut water really tasted like coconut water fact tastes even better fresh coconut water theres subtle sort butteriness flavor thought fluke took another sip finished bottle every drop went unbelievably delicious firstbr br immediately hopped onto amazon started subscribe save subscription first case oz tall cans sans pulp arrived today quick hour freezer tried first son biscuit almost brings tears tell possibly best canned beverage ive ever guzzled tried hard make last almost chugged darned thing deliciousness unstoppablebr br short youre looking good coconut water dont want deal cleaving real coconuts save lot time heartache dont try anything taste nirvana wont regret wish someone else giving advice start misadventures cocohunting

The two issues I had with the Wellness was that, you could only buy it from Petco and of course the price, I was paying $51 for a 30 pound bag. I felt that I could do better. So, I did some research and it seemed that the beneful was the way to go, I bought a bag of the beneful and fed it to my puppy, well, within a few days he was crapping all over the house. Being concerned for his health, but also getting tired of picking up puppy poop, I contacted my local pecto for help and spoke to the trainer, she urged me to immediately stop feeding the puppy the beneful and go back to the Wellness dog food. She even called the beneful ""The Worst Dog food out there"". So I took her advice and immediately saw results in my puppy, he was back to being his healthy, happy, and playful self. I have learned a lesson, not to cut corners on dog food. If buying more expensive food is going to mean a happy puppy, I will spend the money.<br /><br />Update: 1\20\2011<br /><br />I read other review on similar beneful products, other people seemed to have similar problems.

As with any dental treat, the purpose is for the dog to chew it and work the toothpaste that is in the treat around the teeth to get them nice and clean.  The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth.  Also, because the dog eats them in three bites, this product is much more likely to put your dog at risk of choking on them.  This product is very expensive and, from my opinion, I just don't recommend them.",taste perspective dog probably love product however recommend buy dog dental treat purpose dog chew work toothpaste treat around teeth get nice clean problem treat dogs literally eat three bites means treat working teeth also dog eats three bites product much likely put dog risk choking product expensive opinion dont recommend

I know this because I divided them into individual bags each with one of each flavor of lollipop in them and got 40 bags with a few leftovers of every flavor. I handed them out and they recived a great reception. Some of the flavors are more subtle than others because they're made from natural fruit extracts and some people didnt care for certain flavors as others but they all seemed to be mixed and based on individual preferences but over they were a really big hit. I was instantly popular right away and some of them stated even the kids in their families loved them. I immediately tried every flavor and I like them all, some more than others, but again its just a preference thing.

485278,B001RVFERK,ASIMCC20UVK58,R Shackleford,1,1,5,1274400000,Great Chips Less Fat,"I eat chips almost every day and decided I wanted to find something that tastes as good but is lighter on unnecessary fat than regular types of chips. I bought a case of Popchips BBQ. These are satisfying and taste great. They don't taste exactly like any full fat chip products I've had mainly because they're not greasy at all, but they have a nice BBQ potato chip flavor. These are thick, crunchy, and light. I first bought the .8 oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch (would probably be alright for a snack). 3 of the .8 oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake, but considering the same volume of ""regular"" chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what I was looking for. I find the 3 ounce bags to be perfect. Even eating all 3 ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips. This makes Popchips very satisfying to me, and I have bought many cases through Amazon.<br /><br />Heads up (mid-2011): Unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through Amazon, causing me to cancel my subscribe & save subscriptions. Popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce. I love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it's hard to justify paying double for the same product.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty straight forward but here's my thoughts...<br />Original flavor: Tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease. Not my favorite flavor, but good for what it is. This flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip.<br />Chedder: Cheddar quickly became tied with BBQ for my favorite. Like BBQ the cheddar flavor is very strong. Great chips.<br />Salt & Pepper: Very strong pepper. To enjoy these you have to really like pepper. I like them, but they're not a favorite.<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar: I'm not a fan of vinegar, but strangely I enjoy this flavor.

There are many good coffees out there, but to my taste the French Roast has the kick I need.  Because of an attenuated sense of taste (autoimmune problems) I need coffee that has more than the average kick so that I can actually taste the coffee, and Tully's does the job.  My wife, who possesses normal, or beyond a normal sense of taste, agrees with me that this is excellent coffee.  No, it's not for those who like a mild tasting coffee, but unlike a comment I read in another review, it doesn't taste at all like an ashtray smells....not at all!  This is seriously good coffee, and if you like strong tasting coffee, give this a try.  I doubt that you'll be disappointed.*****UPDATE***** It's been about 2 years since I started using Tully""s French Roast K-Cups, and I thought I might add to my original comments.

San Francisco Bay is a close number 2, but Tully's beats it out.  It is hard for me to believe that Starbucks would come in number 3 in a taste test, but it did.

I used to add a few items to the mix to make it even more powerful, i.e. fresh kale, banana, aloe, and flax oil.  Nowadays I simply use a frozen half banana, flax oil, and a touch of carob powder.  Mix it up with a bit of ice and you have a great shake, especially good during the summer months.  And for some crazy ideas, especially during the really hot months, add a bit of Baileys or Kahlua to the mix.  Yum, yum!  It's like having your vegetables with your junk food.

Also, the information the foster mother gave me on what I had thought was high quality cat food (Iams, Purina One, Science Diet) completely changed my outlook.  There is no way I would ever feed that garbage to any of my pets again.<br /><br />My kittens go crazy when I feed them the Wellness twice a day.  Their desperate meows almost sound like gasps - so cute.  I don't want them to become solely dependent on canned, so I will continue to provide them with dry food, too.  (Although, I plan to replace Chicken Soup with a higher quality, grain-free dry brand, like Orijen or Evo.)  And when the kittens are old enough, I will transition them to Wellness canned for adults.<br /><br />If you are reading this review, there's probably a good chance you already know all about cat nutrition (the issues with by-products, brewers rice, corn, some grains, etc.)  For anyone else, I would encourage you to read the nutritional information on various brands at Pet Food Ratings dot Net.  You will never look at cat food the same.<br /><br />***Update October 2012***: Since my original review, I have tried two other kinds of Wellness canned foods - sliced chicken (in the 3 oz. can) and turkey (12.5 oz. cans).  They love both.  Because the 12 oz. cans are much more economical on a per ounce basis, I am going to stick with this size.

133337,B0090X8IPM,AUITG1DJ3QUGK,E. Swope,1,2,3,1290556800,Not as good as their unflavored coffees.,"I am a flat-out fiend for good coffee.  I ordered Starbucks by mail well before they had a string of coffee shops, and I'd venture to guess that were you to order a vanilla latte there, this is not what you would get.<br /><br />I basically never buy flavored coffees, having learned from a friend who worked for a local gourmet coffee company that if you want flavored coffee, you add the flavoring after it is brewed.  Because many delicate natural ingredients are destroyed by the heat required to brew coffee properly most flavored coffees are chemical.  I would not purchase a chemically flavored coffe, or drink it except as aq last resort (i.e., stranded at an airport).  I applaud Starbucks for the effort to make a naturally flavored coffee, and on thinking about it, vanilla beans seem like one of the better candidates to stand up to the heat; after all, they are used in baking at even higher heat.<br />However, this effort falls somewhat flat, or maybe I should say sharp.  While it smells just wonderful when you open the bag, the brewed coffee is bitter with only a faint odor remaining to remind you that it is flavored with vanilla.  I am not familar enough with the chemistry of vanilla (would have to consult <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684800012"">On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen</a> to see if vanilla is fat or water solable.  Maybe it's the butter in cakes and cookies which absorbs the flavor.... but whatever it is that does it in baked goods is missing here.<br /><br />I suspect that Starbucks released this to combat the rise of Dunkin Donuts coffees.  But to my mind that is like a steak house worrying over all the people who flock to McDonalds.  I am hoping that Starbucks maintains the standards which allow us to look to them for a reliably good cup of coffee.  This is a disappointment from a company which knows good coffee, and which should know better.  It would be a lot better had they packaged the coffee with single serve packets of vanilla sugar.<br /><br />The coffee is ground for drip brewers as is most of their ground coffee.  While it is described as a medium roast, it tastes like a French roast (but not a good one).  Because of the larger grind, I am guessing it can be used with a French press.  I will give that a try to see if the vanilla beans hold up any better, and return to this review forthwith.  It was not terrific brewed in a good drip brewer, which is, how I suspect most people would make pre-ground coffee.",flatout fiend good coffee ordered starbucks mail well string coffee shops id venture guess order vanilla latte would getbr br basically never buy flavored coffees learned friend worked local gourmet coffee company want flavored coffee add flavoring brewed many delicate natural ingredients destroyed heat required brew coffee properly flavored coffees chemical would purchase chemically flavored coffe drink except aq last resort ie stranded airport applaud starbucks effort make naturally flavored coffee thinking vanilla beans seem like one better candidates stand heat used baking even higher heatbr however effort falls somewhat flat maybe say sharp smells wonderful open bag brewed coffee bitter faint odor remaining remind flavored vanilla familar enough chemistry vanilla would consult hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproducton food cooking science lore kitchena see vanilla fat water solable maybe butter cakes cookies absorbs flavor whatever baked goods missing herebr br suspect starbucks released combat rise dunkin donuts coffees mind like steak house worrying people flock mcdonalds hoping starbucks maintains standards allow us look reliably good cup coffee disappointment company knows good coffee know better would lot better packaged coffee single serve packets vanilla sugarbr br coffee ground drip brewers ground coffee described medium roast tastes like french roast good one larger grind guessing used french press give try see vanilla beans hold better return review forthwith terrific brewed good drip brewer suspect people would make preground coffee

Within days of starting my cancer-cats on this food they both perked up, gained weight, and actually maintained the last few months of their lives in an active and normal manner. Both of course finally succumbed to cancer, but even the vet was surprised at how long they lived after diagnosis, and how brief the period of their final decline was (they both sort of bottomed out within a two day period at the end).<br /><br />Now, the other piece: I had purchased another Siamese upon learning of my other cats' illness, and he not only loved them, he also loved the Natural Balance food, which was all he got. I noticed that as he grew he was not anemic looking as most siamese are, but actually had good muscle tone. When I brought him for his first vet checkup the vet said, and I quote ""In 20 years, this is the healthiest looking Siamese cat I have ever seen."" She commented on his physique, muscle tone, activity level, coat, etc. I later adopted a Tabby the same age as the Siamese, and got the same response. Both cats just have sleek, beautiful coats, are very athletic and energetic, and love the Natural Balance food.<br /><br />I firmly believe that this food (and I now also use Blue Buffalo Wilderness for some variety) has made a real and noticeable differnce in the health and quality of life of my cats, and I highly recommend it to anyone.

I have been using their dressings for several years.  Not all of their dressings are as good, in my opinion, as the Thousand Island but all will help control blood sugars.  What I like about the Thousand Island particularly is the creamy texture of the dressing and the taste.  You can use it on salads, burger melts or in a low carb rueben wrap. (I use the Santa Fe Tortilla 6 carb wrap)<br /><br />People who complain that Walden Farms products don't taste the same as 'normal' dressings have a valid point and it shows how much we have come to equate 'good taste' with sugar.  One way to check out your favorite dressing or catsup is to look at the ingredients and see how high sugar, corn syrup, and high fructose corn sugar, is on the list. It is no surprise that sugar is often up there near the top and often listed multiple times. Some dressings produced by major brands, however, have only two carbs per serving.  For many people, myself included, this is a tossup.  In some cases taste and cost may swing toward buying the major brand.  For more selections check at the Walden Farms website and don't forget to check at your local grocery or health food store to compare prices on this brand.<br /><br />Clearly, if you are looking to control your families intake of carbs, the Walden Farms brand is a good choice.  If you know of other brands with zero carbs that taste as good or better please add your comments to this review.

52521,B003ANFMY8,ANKMDUQBIWJL9,Jill B. Stuart,1,1,5,1350864000,Obese/overweight cat? Do your research!,"This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding. There do not appear to be industry standards for what's labeled as 'weight management', 'light' etc., and the differences are dramatic!<br /><br />Our very young and energetic cat starting piling on weight from when he was a kitten. Maybe he stuffs himself because he's a 'rescue'--I don't know whether he might have had some starvation in his early weeks that marked him for life! but we had to put him on adult food before his kitten year was up, on the advice of our veterinarian--and he went on to gain weight up to almost 20 lb. even when giving the recommended daily amount of food, measured, divided into 2 daily feedings.<br /><br />We decided to switch from a Purina Pro Plan regular adult formula to their 'weight management' formula--still, kitty was gaining. When I finally did the research of how many kcal/day he should be getting and how many kcal we were giving him (mind you--the recommended, measured amount), I was shocked. The packaging recommends 56-84 g./day of the food for weight loss, for a cat with a goal weight of 10-14 lbs. That's 214-321 calories, measured by their own nutrition information. But my research at [...] showed that the recommended amount should be 187 calories/day for weight loss, for a goal weight of 10-12 lb. That means the *minimum* amount recommended by the Purina label was 27 more calories/day than he should be getting--or 14% more! and the maximum 'recommended' amount was 72% more than he should be getting for weight loss.<br /><br />[...] has a publication with calorie counts/cup of a wide variety of cat food: [...]<br />The range of calories/up is staggering. Anyone with an overweight cat--do your cat a favor and research how many calories/day they *should* be getting, and how many calories the 'recommended' amount that you're feeding actually is.<br /><br />After finding out how much of the Pro Plan Weight Management per day to offer, I thought our problems were over--I started giving him a daily amount with the right calories for weight loss. And he did start losing, at a slow but safe rate: about .2 lb/week. But he was constantly, frantically hungry. I looked further, for a nutritionally sound food that could give him more volume and fill him up while still not exceeding the calories he would need for weight loss. With the help of [...] for nutritional ratings, and the calorie chart on [...], I selected Science Diet Light--with approximately 75% of the calories per cup compared to the Purina Pro Plan. I can now give him 9g/day more, and I think the higher fiber content of this food will help him feel more full. While it does cost more than his previous food, the difference is not going to break the bank--I estimate it will cost me $4 more per month.",really good choice nutritionally sound lower calorie food cat admittedly picky immediately devoured real message need find many kcalday cat needs weight loss research calories cats food accurately measure feeding appear industry standards whats labeled weight management light etc differences dramaticbr br young energetic cat starting piling weight kitten maybe stuffs hes rescuei dont know whether might starvation early weeks marked life put adult food kitten year advice veterinarianand went gain weight almost lb even giving recommended daily amount food measured divided daily feedingsbr br decided switch purina pro plan regular adult formula weight management formulastill kitty gaining finally research many kcalday getting many kcal giving mind youthe recommended measured amount shocked packaging recommends gday food weight loss cat goal weight lbs thats calories measured nutrition information research showed recommended amount caloriesday weight loss goal weight lb means minimum amount recommended purina label caloriesday gettingor maximum recommended amount getting weight lossbr br publication calorie countscup wide variety cat food br range caloriesup staggering anyone overweight catdo cat favor research many caloriesday getting many calories recommended amount youre feeding actually isbr br finding much pro plan weight management per day offer thought problems overi started giving daily amount right calories weight loss start losing slow safe rate lbweek constantly frantically hungry looked nutritionally sound food could give volume fill still exceeding calories would need weight loss help nutritional ratings calorie chart selected science diet lightwith approximately calories per cup compared purina pro plan give gday think higher fiber content food help feel full cost previous food difference going break banki estimate cost per month

Wilder,2,2,5,1320537600,Subscribe and Save a great value on a great cat food,"I'm writing this review to add another strong voice in support of the quality and value of the Harmony dry cat food. Like the other reviewers, I had searched long and far for a food that fit my tough guidelines for healthy ingredients.  I found the indoor formula Harmony cat food at my local supermarket, was impressed after reading the ingredients list and decided to try it on my six cats ranging in age from 1 to 15 years old.  Each cat, without exception, took to the food right away.  When I found the chicken and rice formula at Wegman's (40 miles away), I switched my cats to that because I was concerned that the indoor formula for outdoor cats might not be the right balance of nutrients since Harmony went to the trouble of developing two varieties.  Once again, my cats took to the food right away.  I feed them dry and wet food and decided to try the Harmony canned.  In the past, I needed to mix some of the food I was trying to replace with the new food--but that was not necessary with the Harmony food.  I've been a cat caregiver for most of my 59 years.  I have never found a cat food that was so well received by my feline friends as Harmony.  In fairness to the single one star reviewer in this group, I looked up the Royal Canin brand.  I was not positively impressed by the ingredients list.  Besides that, Royal Canin has at least 3 varieties of dry food--a protein, a smell enhanced, and a texture variety. Huh?  I just wonder if all of the 1 star reviewer's 60 felines can agree on the same variety! On the point of the value of purchasing this food through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, it is by far the best pricing I've found.  Wegman's--again 40 miles away!--sells it for $12.99 with a Wegman's card--$14.99 without.  Through this program, currently I can get the food delivered to my doorstep for $12.66--no more long drives to Wegman's and less expensive to boot!",im writing review add another strong voice support quality value harmony dry cat food like reviewers searched long far food fit tough guidelines healthy ingredients found indoor formula harmony cat food local supermarket impressed reading ingredients list decided try six cats ranging age years old cat without exception took food right away found chicken rice formula wegmans miles away switched cats concerned indoor formula outdoor cats might right balance nutrients since harmony went trouble developing two varieties cats took food right away feed dry wet food decided try harmony canned past needed mix food trying replace new foodbut necessary harmony food ive cat caregiver years never found cat food well received feline friends harmony fairness single one star reviewer group looked royal canin brand positively impressed ingredients list besides royal canin least varieties dry fooda protein smell enhanced texture variety huh wonder star reviewers felines agree variety point value purchasing food amazons subscribe save program far best pricing ive found wegmansagain miles awaysells wegmans card without program currently get food delivered doorstep long drives wegmans less expensive boot

They are really awesome.<br /><br />I admit, I've never been a fan of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with light bread, but I LOVED peanut butter and jelly on graham crackers.  Now that I've gone vegan, I can't eat peanut butter and jelly or graham crackers, but this PB&J Larabar tastes just like the peanut butter and jelly on graham crackers that I used to eat.  And even for non-vegans, these bars are still good - anybody can eat them.  They taste just like whatever the flavor is, and are healthy (even though you'd never know it, because they taste so good!)<br /><br />These bars are healthy, natural, soy-free, vegan, kosher.  They have no added sugar, and no chemicals.  It is amazing how something so natural and simple can be so good.<br /><br />Larabars are good to pack for trips, lunches, or anytime you need some energy (or just food); they are convenient because you don't have to cook, measure, slice, or stir, and you don't need a container with a special lid.  You don't need anything!  You just open and eat!!!  All the flavors are good for energy or hunger-control, but when I am really hungry, my favorite flavors are peanut butter cookie and peanut butter and jelly (the featured flavor in this particular review).  The ones with peanut butter (not really peanut butter, but just peanuts) seem to give me more energy.<br /><br />I love all flavors of Larabars (I haven't yet discovered a flavor that I didn't like), but I do have my favorites, depending on the mood I'm in.  Like I mentioned in the prior paragraph, Peanut butter cookie and peanut butter and jelly are my favorites if I am really hungry.<br /><br />All the flavors of Larabars are healthy, and even though they have no added sugar, they certainly crave my desire for sweets (because they do taste like they have sugar, even though they don't).  I am not really a big ""sweets"" eater; I prefer salts.  If I could just have salty foods all the time, I think I could totally give up sweets.

We came across the Tug-a-Jug and decided to give it a try.  She took to it right away.  It has holes in the bottom so the smell of the treats continue to hold her interest.  The screw-on lid has fine threads so she can not unscrew it.  The rope cord is frayed on the inside to hold in the treats for longer play time.  The unit is made from strong plastic and is too big around for her to use her powerful jaws to crack it.  The rubber ball end is a good place for her to hold as she carries it around the house. Once I fill this toy with food I know she will be ingrossed for at least an hour while she works on getting all the treats.  A couple of things to keep in mind, the treats add to the dogs calorie intake so you have to cut down on meal time, and it can be a weapon if your dog likes to throw it around (I know this from experience!).  The first one I got for her, the cord was much more frayed on the inside so it took longer for her to get all the food.

They ate it eagerly, like they do with any other new food, but over time, I noticed they both seemed to be getting less and less healthy. It was so gradual that my husband and I both didn't really notice until about a month into the new food. They continued to eat it and around the 5th week, they both started getting diarrhea here and there. But my maltese continued to get sicker and sicker. She lost so much weight that her back resembled a stegasaurus, all of a sudden. She no longer had energy to run around and play any longer. She would lay on her bed listlessly and watch me instead of frolicking around, like she usually does. It was so sad. We left for a vacation and left my dogs with a friend with this food. At this point, we were suspicious that the food might have something to do with it, but we weren't positive there was a correlation. But when we got back, I had definite confirmation with my FRIEND'S dog, who ate plenty of their kibble. Her dog (16 year old beagle) was having diarrhea and vomitting while we were away.<br /><br />I have no proof that it was the food as I threw it all in the trash the moment I came back from vacation. But if it were still in my possession, I would definitely send it away for analysis and let the company know that we would definitely NOT ever take a step towards anything their company makes ever again.<br /><br />I urge you to stay away from this food, and if you do decide to take a chance with it, proceed with extreme caution, and keep the original bag so you can let the company know the batch number should any problems arise.

This, of course, can be adjusted for each individual's preference.  The scent is heavenly, as the coffee is brewing and the taste is very robust and holds a light flavor of vanilla.  The vanilla flavoring is a very gentle and light taste, almost a whisper soft hint.  In addition, the taste is not bitter, but smooth and delicious.  I am one who drinks with a bit of sugar and cream, rather than straight black, as well as being rather picky on my coffee, as it bothers my stomach if it is overly acidic.

(may be caffiene free?!),"** I have edited this review to make it shorter, I had some background of my history with tea as well as how I typically make my everyday drink to give others a sense of how I make that tea. all that information is now located in my profile. I have also changed this to a review assigning  points for scent and taste (W/WO sweetener Cold/Hot)<br /><br />Ingredients are not listed completely on item so here they are in the order on the label word for word: Organic Honey bush, Organic Rooibos, Buckwheat(contains no wheat!), mace, cinnamon, ginger, toasted rice, pumpkin flakes, pumpkin flakes, caramel pieces, pumpkin seeds, candied peanuts, sweet potato, natural flavors, stevia leaf.<br /><br />*I have no idea what mace or the ""natural flavors"" are.Reading over the ingredients I am led to believe it is decaf or at least very low on the Caff-o-meter. Rooibos and Honeybush are both naturally caffeine free and in my short research buckwheat is as well (or very low). I'm not against caffeine at all but I appreciate knowing what it is and isn't in<br /><br />-Smell - In bag (4) Steeping (3.5) - when you first open it  the bag smells amazing! Steeping  also provides an enjoyable scent<br /><br />-Taste<br /><br />+Unsweetened : Hot (3)/Cold (3)- This has a natural sweetness to it but not super sweet, I still prefer my added sweetener, but drinking it plain I now know what people talk about when they are saying the teas have a natural sweetness and nutty flavor to them. this may be attributed to the stevia that is in it as well.<br /><br />+Sweetened: Hot(4)/Cold (4.5)-It seems that my sweetener or maybe the pinch of baking soda, adds a bit of body and boldness to the flavor and exemplifies everything.  I am deducting 1 point from the cold because while this tea tastes amazing, I think I'm more enjoying the Rooibos flavor and not detecting as much pumpkin as I may like, but it is definitely there. While not my thing I bet this would be amazing with some milk added to make a chai.<br /><br />*I prefer my teas Iced and  1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-2nd steep(4) - The hot tea on the second steep is somewhat of a letdown but the cold is still tasting great, if possible even better (I steeped for 10 minutes).<br /><br />Overall Average: *3.5 stars<br /><br />Overall: I love Halloween and was looking for something to get me in the mood, and this one does not disappoint. Before this I was just adding pumpkin pie spices to black tea, it got me by but I knew there was something better out there. I am pleased with this tea, as mentioned earlier I believe this is decaf, also due to being rooibos based (no tannins) it will stand up to longer steeping times without getting bitter. One thing I would recommend to the seller is to offer other sizes on amazon, but I am very glad that they offer this ""sample"" size because I am hesitant to purchase the other brands on here that are in larger increments.<br /><br />Feel free to read my other reviews I will be adding more as the season progresses (this is my first).",edited review make shorter background history tea well typically make everyday drink give others sense make tea information located profile also changed review assigning points scent taste wwo sweetener coldhotbr br ingredients listed completely item order label word word organic honey bush organic rooibos buckwheatcontains wheat mace cinnamon ginger toasted rice pumpkin flakes pumpkin flakes caramel pieces pumpkin seeds candied peanuts sweet potato natural flavors stevia leafbr br idea mace natural flavors arereading ingredients led believe decaf least low caffometer rooibos honeybush naturally caffeine free short research buckwheat well low im caffeine appreciate knowing isnt inbr br smell bag steeping first open bag smells amazing steeping also provides enjoyable scentbr br tastebr br unsweetened hot cold natural sweetness super sweet still prefer added sweetener drinking plain know people talk saying teas natural sweetness nutty flavor may attributed stevia wellbr br sweetened hotcold seems sweetener maybe pinch baking soda adds bit body boldness flavor exemplifies everything deducting point cold tea tastes amazing think im enjoying rooibos flavor detecting much pumpkin may like definitely thing bet would amazing milk added make chaibr br prefer teas iced cup packet sweetener unless wows without sweetener always lower points compensate add points unsweetened taste averagebr br nd steep hot tea second steep somewhat letdown cold still tasting great possible even better steeped minutesbr br overall average starsbr br overall love halloween looking something get mood one disappoint adding pumpkin pie spices black tea got knew something better pleased tea mentioned earlier believe decaf also due rooibos based tannins stand longer steeping times without getting bitter one thing would recommend seller offer sizes amazon glad offer sample size hesitant purchase brands larger incrementsbr br feel free read reviews adding season progresses first

Once you grind your own coffee you just can never go back to coffee in a can, or certainly not instant coffee. Well, whole bean coffees are expensive in a grocery store or supermarket. I've discovered a lower-cost alternative. I pick up two or three pound containers at Trader Joe's or Costco. The Costco source is particularly interesting in that they always seem to have two or three different kinds, but the kinds seem to change on every other visit. Over the years, I've had coffees from all over the world. This latest time there was a pallet of Kirkland Signature Dark Roast Espresso Blend (with a little tag that said roasted by Starbucks Coffee Co.) The aroma around the display was excellent and I couldn't resist.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, the rich aroma was almost overwhelming. My wife even loved it and she isn't a coffee drinker. The coffee itself isn't all that impressive. It has a good light tasty flavor that seems mild and slightly sweet and goes down quite easily. I'd have to guess that the caffeine content was not up to the level I was used to in other whole-bean coffees and it doesn't provide that good morning jolt. I was expecting something richer and more robust, more like a dark roast. Well, this is a nice coffee, but if you're looking for something that will grow hair on your chest, this is not the one. It has a good flavor, but it's weak. I'll have no trouble finishing the bag, but I'm disappointed.

The reason? Japanese mayo is different. And it tastes better.<br /><br />Before that, I was only familiar with standard American supermarket varieties like Hellman's and Kraft, and the idea of putting them on things like leaf salads and fries wasn't particularly appealing.<br /><br />Kewpie, though the ingredients are similar, has a pronounced tanginess that balances the rich creamy texture, making it ideal as a mainline topping for a wide variety of foods. They go great on fries (Belgian style), leaf salads, and grilled meats. Japanese people put mayo on a lot of things, including okonomiyaki, takoyaki, yakitori, even pizza.<br /><br />There is something decidedly fun about the squirt nozzle. It is much more convenient than American jar mayos that you have to scoop out and then plop onto the food in a big glob. The bottle itself is shaped like a pastry bag, with an opening about the diameter of a strand of cooked spaghetti. This allows you to squirt mayo with precision over your food, letting you control its distribution as well as design. Food I had in Japan often came with cross-hatched mayo patterns, like the pattern you see on the bag. If you remove the cap, the inner opening is star shaped, allowing for more decorating fun if you have kids.<br /><br />It is far superior to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5EAK"">Kraft Mayo Real Mayonnaise, 18-Ounce Easy Squeeze Bottles</a>, which come in an overly-rigid bottle with a horizontal slot that easily introduces air into the bottle as it re-inflates for the next squeeze, causing frequent splatter. Mayo also clings to the bottle's side and I have to give it a good hard jerk to get enough dislodged for another squeeze. Kewpie doesn't have this problem. It is soft and pliable like a toothpaste tube. Splattering is never an issue and the free-flowing consistency of the mayo formulation makes getting it all out quite easy. The bottle is also transparent and devoid of any stickers and labels, making it easy to see how much is left, and its tapered design channels the mayo into the opening.<br /><br />Nutrition values are similar to American mayo. 100 calories per tablespoon (90 from fat), 20mg cholesterol, 100mg sodium. It does not contain any preservatives or artificial additives besides MSG. Kewpie is made in Japan, not in US subsidiary factories, so this is a true taste of a Japanese favorite. Give it a try and see why this is loved by so many people in Japan and Japanese food lovers the world over.",never liked mayonnaise went japan gained new respect appreciation condiment reason japanese mayo different tastes betterbr br familiar standard american supermarket varieties like hellmans kraft idea putting things like leaf salads fries wasnt particularly appealingbr br kewpie though ingredients similar pronounced tanginess balances rich creamy texture making ideal mainline topping wide variety foods go great fries belgian style leaf salads grilled meats japanese people put mayo lot things including okonomiyaki takoyaki yakitori even pizzabr br something decidedly fun squirt nozzle much convenient american jar mayos scoop plop onto food big glob bottle shaped like pastry bag opening diameter strand cooked spaghetti allows squirt mayo precision food letting control distribution well design food japan often came crosshatched mayo patterns like pattern see bag remove cap inner opening star shaped allowing decorating fun kidsbr br far superior hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbeqeakkraft mayo real mayonnaise ounce easy squeeze bottlesa come overlyrigid bottle horizontal slot easily introduces air bottle reinflates next squeeze causing frequent splatter mayo also clings bottles side give good hard jerk get enough dislodged another squeeze kewpie doesnt problem soft pliable like toothpaste tube splattering never issue freeflowing consistency mayo formulation makes getting quite easy bottle also transparent devoid stickers labels making easy see much left tapered design channels mayo openingbr br nutrition values similar american mayo calories per tablespoon fat mg cholesterol mg sodium contain preservatives artificial additives besides msg kewpie made japan us subsidiary factories true taste japanese favorite give try see loved many people japan japanese food lovers world

Her teeth were stained and layered with plaque. Her guns were bright red along the edges. She had Gingivitis. I was facing a $300+ teeth cleaning bill for the cat. The vet recommended I try Hill's Dental Diet first. After two months of eating it, the cat returned to the vet. The large, hard nuggets had cleaned the plaque from her teeth. Her gums were no longer red, but pink and healthy. Hill's did what was needed. I am thrilled with the results.<br /><br />Yes, this food is expensive, but so is a teeth cleaning bill for a cat, as well as dental problems if you don't. Once my cat's mouth improved, I cut back on the Hill's. I feed my cat a main diet of Purina dry, but I still give her 8-10 Hill's nuggets a day. She's been on this mixed diet for one year and her teeth and gums are still good and healthy.

Definitely not THE BEST, since in my country you can easily have imported beans roasted and ground at the moment.<br />Second: It is NOT for use in auto dripping machines. The type of grinding is too thin. American coffee is made with coarse grind. This is to be used with espresso machines, or ""caffettiera"", amongst which Bialetti is the best brand, or pressure steam machines, those you find at the coffe shops.<br />Third: to all of you who say ""it's bitter"": just put sugar in it, in Italy we put sugar in espresso. If you don't use sugar it is SUPPOSED to be bitter. To all of you who say it doesn't give you the ""caffeine shot"": that's not what espresso is for. If you need caffeine and need to wake up drink one of those energy drinks you can find at every store across the USA. Or just take some day off, sleep more and work less, like we do in Italy.

But if you are looking for the best that Amazon has to offier, this does NOT compare to the DoMatcha 1st harvest organic matcha.  I tried DoMatcha and loved it, and I only strayed based on  the price...this IS a lot less and the reviews seems good enough.  Specifically: It IS about as green as DoMatcha (but  not quite) and decently smooth tasting, just not as ""bright"" as the DoMatcha 1st harvest.  I do not like the way it is packaged...as once you open it, it is loose in the tin (versus in a foil pouch), so you are going to lose some powder each time you make it just from opening the container. So even though it is cheaper, and you get a small fraction more, you are technically wasting some of the tea.  The tea, also doesn't blend easily with my traditional method of making a paste, then adding milk (I use almond milk) and hot water (not too hot!) and frothing it with the bamboo whisk along the way in stages.  Others have talked about having to sift their matcha, and this particular tea would seem to benefit from sifting, but who has time for that if it isn't necessary?  I have been making a small pitcher of this tea each morning and there is always sediment at the bottom of the pitcher and my cup and I did not experience this with DoMatcha.

Well, I can't comment knowledgeably on that, but I can say that the Bartolini brand is by far the best that we have tried, and tastes and smells strongly of truffle.  We use this primarily as a finishing oil, on risotto and scrambled eggs, where the quality of the underlying oil is critical, and have been really happy with the Bartolini oil.  I first used this product when living in London, and had friends bring some out for me when I hadn't been able to find a good alternative in the US, so am delighted to find this on Amazon.<br /><br />The oil is a bright yellow, and the base oil smells like a good quality extra virgin oil.  Each bottle at least has a small piece of truffle in the bottom, lending some support at least to the idea that the oil is infused.  If there is artificial flavor added, as some reviewers have suggested there has to be, then all I can say is that the resulting taste certainly doesn't have a chemical, or artificial taint, unlike some other brands we have tried.<br /><br />In particular, we have also used the Tourangelle brand, available in a tin from Amazon and Whole Foods, which is absolutely ghastly, and the quality of the oil used for that brand is appalling.  The end product is pale, tasteless and almost without any aroma, let alone that of truffles.  The presentation in a tin is unattractive and also lends the oil a somewhat metallic taint...just a generally awful product.  I guess they realize that the product looks so bad that if they put it in glass they'd never sell any of it.  Perhaps they think people are going to use it as a cooking, rather than a finishing oil, which is completely inappropriate....you could hope that heating it may burn off the dreadful chemical taint!<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a good option, that looks and smells good on the food, and at least gives the impression that it is a natural oil, I don't think you can go past this product.",ive read whole lot reviews various different brands truffle oil number suggest way infusing truffle flavor oil full chemicals well cant comment knowledgeably say bartolini brand far best tried tastes smells strongly truffle use primarily finishing oil risotto scrambled eggs quality underlying oil critical really happy bartolini oil first used product living london friends bring hadnt able find good alternative us delighted find amazonbr br oil bright yellow base oil smells like good quality extra virgin oil bottle least small piece truffle bottom lending support least idea oil infused artificial flavor added reviewers suggested say resulting taste certainly doesnt chemical artificial taint unlike brands triedbr br particular also used tourangelle brand available tin amazon whole foods absolutely ghastly quality oil used brand appalling end product pale tasteless almost without aroma let alone truffles presentation tin unattractive also lends oil somewhat metallic taintjust generally awful product guess realize product looks bad put glass theyd never sell perhaps think people going use cooking rather finishing oil completely inappropriateyou could hope heating may burn dreadful chemical taintbr br youre looking good option looks smells good food least gives impression natural oil dont think go past product

It was available locally, came with some recommendations (though reading online opinions were all over the map), and I needed to change food for allergy concerns.  Anyway My dog never quite took to it, and we switched to Flint River Ranch.  My dog eats the Flint River food, but he's still loosing weight as he can't eat enough of it.  Thus I'm trying this route, with great success.  He eats whatever he has in front of him, and then he cleans up the crumbs (the smallish and light kibble stick to his jowls and fly out of the bowl).  I couldn't be happier withe behavior like that in the kitchen or the more solid treasures he leaves in the yard.  All in all it's a great food.

She would scream and cry and refused to be soothe for about three hours every night due to her gas pains.  We almost feared that we had a colicky baby, but around 3-3.5 months old she started settling down as her digestive system matured. She was BF for the first 6 months, so needless to say, when we had to slowly start transitioning her to formula around 5.5 months (due to low milk production) I was terrified that the painful gas and fussiness would return. My daughter wouldn't take the powder version and they used RTF at the hospital to supplement her the first couple of days due to low birth weight. I mixed Enfamil's Infant Premium and Gentlease RTFs in the beginning in hopes to transition her to 100% Infant Premium (which she is on now). I am not entirely sure if Gentlease helped with my daughter's fussiness and gas, but it definitely didn't hurt or upset her digestive system. It didn't interrupt her daily BM (considering that she was coming from full-time BF to formula) and she also didn't notice the taste difference from the Infant Premium.<br /><br />After reading the other reviewer's comment about receiving spoiled formula, I tasted each can I opened.  Gentlease tastes like a slightly watered down version of the Infant Premium, but it does have a very slight bitter after taste that the Infant Premium doesn't have (which is normal). The formula from Amazon had a long expiration date (which means it was fresher) and the cans were dent-free, but I still made sure to taste every batch I made. The cans do need to be opened with a can opener and must be used within 48 hours after opening. I transferred the entire contents to an airtight pitcher and used it that way because you should not be storing an open can in the fridge. Overall, I liked the formula and would recommend people give it a try to ease the transition from BF to formula.",daughter severe gas pains first three months life caused extremely fussyespecially evenings would scream cry refused soothe three hours every night due gas pains almost feared colicky baby around months old started settling digestive system matured bf first months needless say slowly start transitioning formula around months due low milk production terrified painful gas fussiness would return daughter wouldnt take powder version used rtf hospital supplement first couple days due low birth weight mixed enfamils infant premium gentlease rtfs beginning hopes transition infant premium entirely sure gentlease helped daughters fussiness gas definitely didnt hurt upset digestive system didnt interrupt daily bm considering coming fulltime bf formula also didnt notice taste difference infant premiumbr br reading reviewers comment receiving spoiled formula tasted opened gentlease tastes like slightly watered version infant premium slight bitter taste infant premium doesnt normal formula amazon long expiration date means fresher cans dentfree still made sure taste every batch made cans need opened opener must used within hours opening transferred entire contents airtight pitcher used way storing open fridge overall liked formula would recommend people give try ease transition bf formula

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"" or ""happy bowels"" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

123291,B001E5E2ZO,ALIDUZEWPVOCU,"JT, too.",0,2,1,1322697600,Very Unpleasant Aftertaste,"I recently purchased a bottle each of the Sugar Free Chocolate and the regular Vanilla because I had two $1.00 coupons for this product, and I thought why not try it, as I love coffee and thought this product may be a nice treat to add to my coffee. After drinking two or three cups of coffee with either the regular Vanilla or the Sugar Free Chocolate, I can tell you that the regular Vanilla is okay but nothing to get excited about, and the Sugar Free Chocolate leaves everything to be desired.  After trying two flavours, I certainly would not rush to send emails to friends and family to tell them of a great find for their coffee.<br /><br />The sugar free leaves behind a very, very unpleasant aftertaste in my opinion, even though I am used to diet soda, etc. The aftertaste is so strong and so unpleasant that the only way I am able to get rid of the aftertaste is to brush my teeth!  Something that is delicious does not make you want to brush your teeth after drinking it.  The regular Vanilla was better than the Sugar Free Chocolate, but of course, it has a whopping 20 sugars per serving, which is more than a can of regular soda. Twenty sugars is a very high sugar count, and it is very fattening, so the sugared varieties are not something one would want to use regularly unless one was intentionally trying to put on weight.<br /><br />Also, I have noticed that these syrups tend NOT to remain well mixed in my coffee despite the fact that I stir well.  I plan to offer the bottle of Sugar Free Chocolate to a friend (albeit with a warning) because the aftertaste is just too unpleasant for me.  The Sugar Free Chocolate should be called Bitter Chocolate in my opinion.  I even added real sugar to my coffee with the Sugar Free Chocolate, and not even real sugar helped!  The Sugar Free version is simply a waste of money in my opinion.  If adding real sugar does not improve the taste, you know there is something in this product which is not very good, and I think it is the Splenda sugar substitute.  Personally, I have always found Equal to be the best sugar substitute.  I have never used Splenda or products containing Splenda before, but I think Equal would have been a much, much better choice for sugar substitution here.<br /><br />My advice is not to purchase the sugar free varieties because they are just not very tasty and leave such an unpleasant aftertaste. Buy the regular varieties, if you must, and use them once in a while as a treat in your coffee or your soda instead of having a dessert for example.  Also, be prepared to keep your spoon in cup in order to keep stirring your coffee before each sip to keep the syrup mixed in the coffee, otherwise, it separates and can be seen to sort of float on the top in a very unappealing way. I cannot understand why it will not stay well mixed in coffee.

I've been taking it since the end of January and my skin still breaks out a little bit, but I stopped taking it for a couple of days and my face broke out a lot so I suppose that it is having some sort of an effect. An online review I read said that most people's skin cleared after eight months in an study, so I am staying positive.<br /><br />I started out by taking Swansons' Brewer's Yeast Powder, and mixed it in smoothies and grapefruit juice. I tried mixing it in orange juice, which was pretty bad, and even just having it with water, which was horrible and made me gag. Because I wasn't crazy about the taste, I read some reviews and decided to try this product next. The taste is much better, it is much less noticeable, especially if I add a little bit of peanut butter or grapefruit juice to the smoothies. The taste is also not at all noticeable in warmed apple juice. I don't have the courage to try it in plain water, though.<br /><br />What I dislike about this product is that it does not dissolve well. I cannot stir it in any cold liquid without getting clumps (hopeless when stirred with a spoon or knife, somewhat works when stirred with a fork but little clumps remain), I can barely dissolve all of it in warmed liquids, and if I put it first in my blender when I make the smoothies, a lot of it remains at the bottom. In that respect, I liked Swansons' Brewer's Yeast better. This one is a little bit high maintenance because if I want to just have it in grapefruit juice, I have to put it in the blender first and when I make smoothies, I have to make sure that it's one of the last things to go in.

I do, however, have two problems with it. First, the box states the product is ""made with real ingredients,"" yet it contains the artificial sweetener sucralose (which is marketed under the trade name Splenda). The use of sucralose in no way invalidates the other ""real"" ingredients like tea leaves and strawberries, but it also means that not every ingredient in the drink is *natural* (something people often infer when the term ""real"" is used). Second, each packet contains enough for TWO bottles of water - if you pour the whole packet into one bottle, it will probably be significantly too sweet.<br /><br />Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.

I ordered two of these and at first both Harley and Elvis took a while to play with them, lots of sniffing and walking away and then back to the horn for more sniffing and the occasional slurp. Then BAM! they couldn't get enough of these gigantic dinosaur bone sized chew toys.<br /><br />They spent hours chewing and gnawing away. Unlike deer antlers which dogs can crack their teeth on, this is much less likely with elk horn. Even when we tossed the both of  them on the bed to call it a night they each had their prized new elk horn in their mouths.Where they continued to chew and gnaw until they passed out.<br /><br />These things are huge! over 10"" long and very heavy, the last thing you'll want to have happen is drop one on your foot.These make amazing toys for your dog - and considering how long they last they're an excellent value to boot.",reservations giving dogs elk horn something rubbed wrong waywe two old english bulldogs six year old harley partner crime seven month puppy named elvis extreme hardcore aggressive chewers guys go kongs nylabones like beaver buzzing x br br dog lover entire life researching dog food long internet better half years share passion dogs thats hard describe every way family indulge extent watch thembr br making dog food plus years ive learned research never stop theres always learn keeping dogs healthy happy according one study canadian veterinary journal elk horn healthy wonderful addition dogs well beingbr br elk horn offers powerhouse benefitsbr br fights arthritisbr br replaces joint fluidbr br effective reliving pain joint disorders arthritisbr br natural preventative treatment osteoporosisbr br easily digestible source calcium trace mineralsbr br cruelty free elks naturally shed antlersbr br list goes thats brief summary advantages ordered two first harley elvis took play lots sniffing walking away back horn sniffing occasional slurp bam couldnt get enough gigantic dinosaur bone sized chew toysbr br spent hours chewing gnawing away unlike deer antlers dogs crack teeth much less likely elk horn even tossed bed call night prized new elk horn mouthswhere continued chew gnaw passed outbr br things huge long heavy last thing youll want happen drop one footthese make amazing toys dog considering long last theyre excellent value boot

She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.

The campsite itself had two memorable things, the first was a play ground my brother and I would spend time at, and the second was a small candy shop down by the end of the road leading up to the camp site, it was in this candy store that I had my first box of Nerds.<br /><br />My brother and I looked all over the candy store with the wide eyed wonder of the literal kid in a candy shop. The one thing that caught my eye was the small pink and purple box of candy up by the register.

Its tasty and its also relatively low cal (check out the nutritional data). Its something served all the time in the UK that most Americans have never heard of. Most of my American friends kind of turn their noses up at the idea of it till I actually have them try it, and then they like it a lot and want to know where they can buy it. This stuff really is very tasty, think of it as being sort of like hot vichyssois only not quite.<br /><br />UNFORTUNATELY Amazon ships these not bound together in any sort of a secure way, they just put them in a box thats too big, with a few of those air pillow things. The weight of the cans is such that the first time they squash the pillows, the pillows pop, meaning 8 heavy cans are now in a box that is way to big for them flying around and slamming into each other. By the time the product arrives it looks like someone was using it to play kick the can, and the air pillows are now all flat.<br /><br />Food in dented cans does not have the same life expectancy (think days rather than months depending on how bad the dent is), and in fact its important that you eat it right away because botulism can develop and that stuff will kill you.<br /><br />Considering this is not a cheap item, as in seriously not cheap, its really disheartening that Amazon persists in not doing a better job of packing it before shipping. I've ordered it from them 3 times now and each time, the condition of the product is the same. The first time, I called to complain and Amazon reimbursed me for the damaged product but had none in stock to re-ship. The second time, same problem, only this time they still had product, so they reshipped it only again it arrived completely dented -- I was handing out cans to all my friends saying... ""here great soup, only eat it in the next day or two 'cause its about to go bad.""<br /><br />So the product is a great one, but how Amazon packs it for shipping it destroys it.<br /><br />Edit: April '09, I just noticed a NEW feature on Amazon's page where you check the status of your shipments. There is now a specific link for complaining about bad packing that resulted in a damaged product. YAY!

A look at the ingredients reflects that it contains four juices: apple, grape, acerola, and cherry.  Since ingredients must be listed in descending order, it makes sense that this drink tastes more like apple than cherry.  The inclusion of acerola juice is good from a health standpoint since it is very high in vitamin C (one can of this stuff contains 100% of the USRDA of vitamin C), but apart from that this isn't a particularly healthy drink since it derives all of its calories from sugars.  It's certainly better than a high fructose corn sweetener produced soda, but it's still calorie rich.  Anyone who's concerned about his/her weight would be better to eat whole fruits instead of drinking fruit juice or sugar/HFCS sweetened sodas.<br /><br />I'll confess that I'm not a huge soda drinker nor a big juice drinker, so that might be coloring my perception of this beverage.  Still, I found it disappointing that the flavor was basically that of weak apple juice and the carbonation was extremely mild.<br /><br />ADDITION ON 4/9/09:<br /><br />I just looked at some of the other reviews of this product and am perplexed.  How can some people find this beverage to have a strong cherry flavor when others like myself barely taste the cherry?

I hadn't eaten potato chips in years, as the taste vs. unhealthy comparison always came up negative.  With the introduction of Kettle Chips brand and widespread availibity of them and Route 11, and competition from the big manfacturers, the chip bar has been raised.  However, they haven't gotten any healthier, so I try to keep them still as a ""sometimes"" snack.<br /><br />I'd seen Popchips in the store, and had wondered if they were any good, but never made the plunge.  Amazon was offering them at a discount price, and with the other reviews adding to my curiosity, I went for it...and was happy with the results.<br /><br />Popchips have a different texture than traditional potato chips.  They are a bit fluffier with more thickness.  I'd put the texture somewhere between Munchos and a mini-rice cake.  However, they still have a satisfying potato chip crunch and potato flavor.  I am typically a salt & vinegar chip fan, but in the case of Popchips, the BBQ is the real standout.  The BBQ flavor is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy, with just a little bit of tanginess.  Every friend who we've introduced to them has been pleasantly surprised and gone off to buy their own.<br /><br />If the health factor wasn't part of the equation - would I choose Popchips over Kettle Brand?  For most varieties, its probably a no - potato chips still have a great crunch that's hard to give up.  But for BBQ, I think that Popchips has it nailed - their flavor is better than any other BBQ chip I've had, so they come out on top.

Osterhout ""Cindy O""",0,0,5,1310083200,What a Deal,"About a month ago, I found a deal on Amazon by which I was able to order two, three lb. bags of this flavor of Fancy Feast and so I set the three lb bags up to come to my house every three months. Then, I was cruising through the Fancy Feast aisles looking for some wet food with cheese in it by Fancy Feast when I happened across these bags. After I read up on these, I decided to cancel the other order and put this in to be delivered at 6 month intervals with Subscribe and Save.<br />I will be getting more food at one time than I was previously BUT there are some real positives to it for me.<br />Number one: I like getting my wet and dry cat food delivered to my home. It saves me from tromping off to PetCo so often. When I go to PetCo, I am like a kid in a candy store. They have SO MUCH stuff. I tend to get carried away and buy things I don't need. Now I will be going only once or twice a year to get foods that my kitties cannot get from Amazon. That I can handle.<br />Number 2: Since these are packaged in 16 ounce packages, I can just rip one open and put in in my Kibble bowl which holds 48 ounces. It takes my kitties quite a while to eat their way through that. Now, I do not have to store open cat food in my closet. With the larger packages, I was doing that. I would mix the flavors to keep the kitties happy with a variety of tastes, but as a consequence had 3 open bags of cat food in my closet. That meant that the kibble got spilled on the floor and I was forever having to pick it up. With these packages, I can still mix the 3 flavors, but will not have kibble dripping in my closet as a result.<br />Number 3: the kibble will stay fresher. In addition to still providing the kitties with a variety of tastes, I will now always have fresh tastes for them. Lord knows how stale that stuff gets after it sits in a 7 pound bag which is open, for a while. Now the spoiled mousers will always have fresh food which is carried to the door by someone else.<br />Number 4: Kitties stay healthy. The primary staple of my kitties diet is Fancy Feast Kibble. They each get a can of wet food each evening as a supplement. I do this to increase the fluid intake of the male to keep his urinary tract in good shape. I just had the cats to the vet and he said they are in great health and to keep doing whatever I am doing. So, Fancy Feast Kibble it is.<br />Number 5: The Ferals like it too. I have one or two feral cats who come to my door each night for their supper. The basic ingredient is Fancy Feast. Needless to say, they continue to show up night after night, so I gather it pleases their palate also.<br />So all kitties are happy and healthy here.

I've seen it before and always fluffed it off as being a unnecessary waste of money. I mean, instant coffee isn't exactly known for bold taste, which I prefer. I'm  a ""coffee snob"" who needs a black or bold roast cup of cofeee every morning or I'll be intolerable. My favorite from Starbucks has always been french roast (smoky and strong). After hearing a friend rave about these, I decided to purchase them given how similar our tastes are. I tried both the Italian and French Roast Via in small packs (from target and starbuck stores). Unlike other instant coffee, it doe not include any creamer or sugar. It's just plain black coffee.

433184,B0009YUI86,A14AZ5HGGKQNYE,"Jennifer ""MedWonk""",19,21,3,1305504000,"Low fat, but not Blue's lowest calorie formula","Note: Blue Buffalo no longer makes ""Weight Control"" dog food and instead makes ""Healthy Weight"" dog food in the ""Life Protection line.  Healthy Weight has 415 calories per cup and 3.290 calories/gram.  Compared to the Longevity line for adult dogs, Healthy Weight has more calories per cup but a fewer calories per gram, meaning that Healthy Weight has more grams per cup than Longevity. Looking at the order of ingredients (which is by pre-production ingredient weight), I am concerned that too much of Healthy Weight's protein may come from whole grains, which do not contain all of the amino acids that a dog must get from his or her food (dogs cannot synthesize all the amino acids they need from plants and grains the way humans can.) De-boned chicken is the first ingredient, but, because it contains 75% water before processing, it is not the heaviest final ingredient.  Chicken meal is a high quality protein, but it is listed as the fifth ingredient.<br /><br />Also: At the bottom of this review I name a brand of food that ultimately helped me meet my dog's goals.<br /><br />Overview of Weight Control: While I did not do all I could to make Weight Control work for my dog, it ultimately did not help my dog reach his ideal weight. Blue Weight Control is nutrient rich, very low in fat, and uses high-quality protein sources. Unfortunately, Blue Weight Control has 444 calories per cup, which  is pretty calorie-dense.  I believe it was over 4 calories per gram, which, in human food, is the caloric density of cheddar cheese.  My dog may have been able to eat a satisfying quantity of this food if he only needed to maintain a healthy weight, but he needed to lose weight, and the portions I had to feed him were too small. Fortunately, Blue Buffalo makes an excellent food called <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P9XFV4"">Blue Buffalo Longevity Dry Food for Adult Dogs, 24-Pound Bag</a>, and the adult food has a more reasonable 354 calories per cup, allowing my dog to eat a more satisfying quantity of food per day.<br /><br />Details: My dog weighed 50 lbs. and needed to get to the maximum ideal weight for his breed --44 lbs.-- as determined by my vet and the American Kennel Club.  According to several dog nutritionists, the calories a dog should consume per day to lose weight is computed as follows:  1)Convert his goal weight in pounds to kilograms by dividing the pounds by 2.2.  For my dog 44 lbs over 2.2= 20.  2  Multiply her weight in KG by 30.  For my dog 20*30 is 600. (3)Add 70. In my dog's case, that meant 670 calories per day.  This number represents the dog's caloric needs while on a weight loss diet, assuming the dog has no special needs, such as pregnant or whelping, being a puppy, being a toy breed, working, or living outdoors in cold weather. The formula only is valid if the dog weighs between 5 and 99 pounds. Check with your vet to make sure the daily calories you compute are in the right neighborhood.<br /><br />The reason Blue Weight Control was not the best Blue Buffalo food for my dog was because it is is relatively calorie dense-- 444 calories per cup. To feed him 670 total calories per day, I could only feed him 1.5 cups per day, meaning that each of his two meals could only be 3/4 cups, and that was without even a tiny buffer for a single green bean as a treat. (Later I explain why I had to add-in other foods.  I ended up only feeding him 2/3 of a cup for each meal, and that really worried me about the adequacy of his nutrition. This quantity of food is well below the feeding guidelines on the bag. My dog was miserable and begged constantly. He would even lick his empty bowl between meals.  I tried feeding him a 1/3 cup (10 calories) of plain no-added-salt canned green beans as a snack, just to help fill his stomach, but he was not content and eventually turned his nose up at the green bean snacks.  I should have added warm water to his dog food and stirred in the green beans, but I wasn't smart enough to do so at the time. My dog kept acting hungry and begging for more dog food.  He would actually walk over to the bag of dog food, put his paw on it, and look at me while whining softly! Other members of my household would sneak table food to him because he begged so persistently, and the ""diet"" was a abysmal failure.  My poor dog ended up actually gaining 4 more pounds from all the human cheating!<br /><br />I was glad I found Blue Longevity adult food.  It has 354 calories per cup as opposed to 444. It has 3.384 calories/gram.  I gave my dog 1.8 cups per day (in 2 meals) for 640 calories. A saleswomen at Petsmart explained that I could help increase my dog's feeling of fullness even more by adding warm water to to his food, enough to just cover the kibble, and letting it sit on the counter a minute so that the kibble would swell up. I should then stir in 10 calories (a little less than 1/4 cup) of no-added-salt green beans to make it an even more filling meal. I did all of these changes together, so I can't separate the effects. My dog stopped the whining and began to lose the weight.<br /><br />I budgeted him only 10 calories per day for treats. The problem was, I had to find something to give as a treat at least 3 times per day.  See, my dog lived in a no-kill shelter for 18 month, so I had to use treats to re-housebreak him. Now he refuses to do #2 unless he is guaranteed a treat (if he doesn't get one immediately after he goes, he lies down on the ground and makes us carry him home--even if we are two blocks from the house and it is dark and pooring down rain. Welcome to my world of loving an Australian Cattle Dog.) I was surprised to learn that small sized Milk Bones have 20 calories each and contributed to him getting overweight to begin with. Even breaking one in half wasn't enough to make his treat calories reasonable. I found a bite-sized treat that is only 1-2 calories called <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VHZ84A"">Premier Liver Biscoti Dog Treats, Original Recipe, Original Bite Size, 8oz. Bag</a>).  They were fine as a substitute for Milk Bones. I recently found a 2-calorie  treat that my dog is crazy about called <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KVSPIC"">Zuke's Mini Naturals Salmon Dog Treats</a> (not to be confused with the 10-calorie each <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055TM554"">Zuke's Mini Bakes Chicken N Cherryz, 16 oz</a>. My dog would probably walk through fire for the Salmon flavored ones, but he also likes the peanut butter flavored ones.<br /><br />Update: I eventually found a web site called DogFoodAdvisor.com.  Through it, I found another food called  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ML7S0"">Premium Edge Healthy Weight I Weight Reduction Formula Adult Dry Dog Food, 35-Pound</a> that has the same calories per cup as Longevity but that has twice as much protein (also from high quality sources!)

Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a ""good"" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought ""stuff"", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes!

537009,B000ZGW714,A2DSXA1E02C86D,Joseph Haschka,0,0,4,1310860800,The emphasis is on oats,"BOBO'S OAT BARS, named after the oldest daughter of entrepreneur and bar's creator Beryl Stafford, are ""baked from the heart in Boulder, Colorado"" and should prove to be a delight for oat lovers. The fact that the bar comes in several flavors - almond, apricot, banana, chocolate, cinnamon-raisin, coconut, cranberry, original, peanut butter, strawberry - may be irrelevant for reasons I shall mention.<br /><br />At 3.5 inches x 2.25 inches x 1 inch, the bar is a dense, heavy, and pleasantly sweet treat with a strong oat flavor. Each bar is defined as two 180 calorie servings, which is absurd because nobody's going to eat only half the bar. (As a matter of fact, I'll thumb my nose at the Food Police and eat two before I go to the gym. So, there!) Each serving also has 6g fat (2g saturated), 20mg sodium, 9g sugars, 3g fiber, and 3g protein. But no cholesterol or trans fat.<br /><br />The ingredients list for the banana version contains some things I've never run across before:<br /><br />""Organic rolled oats, brown rice syrup, earth balance (expeller-pressed natural soy, palm, canola, and olive oil blend), filtered water, pure salt, natural flavor, soy lecithin, lactic acid (non-dairy) and annatto extract (color), organic sucanat (non-refined cane sugar), dried bananas (bananas, fructose), xantham gum. Contains soy. May contain traces of tree nuts and peanuts.""<br /><br />The ingredient ""earth balance"" sounds meaningless but very PC. These days, that's inordinately important.<br /><br />Annatto extract is derived from the tropical achiote tree.<br /><br />And ""pure salt""? Does any ingredients list on a foodstuff include ""impure salt""?<br /><br />""Sucanat"" is derived from ""SUcre de CAnne NATurel"", which is dried sugar cane juice that retains its molasses content.<br /><br />When it comes to familiarity with common ingredients list components, I need to get out more. Perhaps they offer a night-school class for aging boomers at the local community college.<br /><br />The reason I'm not awarding five stars is that the ostensible banana taste was so subtle as to be virtually non-existent. The only other Bobo's version I've tried was the apricot, and that also seemed minimally flavored. The muted essences were unexpected in something so dense, especially as the oats come across so strongly.<br /><br />The high points of the bar are, for me, the oat flavor and the ""mouth feel."" It goes great with cold moo juice. Despite their high price at local outlets - $2.69 per bar - I'd buy more, and make an effort to sample the other flavors to see if they're better presented.<br /><br />P.S. 8/9/11: See my review of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZH04KY"">Bobo's Oat Bars All Natural, Chocolate, 3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>.",bobos oat bars named oldest daughter entrepreneur bars creator beryl stafford baked heart boulder colorado prove delight oat lovers fact bar comes several flavors almond apricot banana chocolate cinnamonraisin coconut cranberry original peanut butter strawberry may irrelevant reasons shall mentionbr br inches x inches x inch bar dense heavy pleasantly sweet treat strong oat flavor bar defined two calorie servings absurd nobodys going eat half bar matter fact ill thumb nose food police eat two go gym serving also g fat g saturated mg sodium g sugars g fiber g protein cholesterol trans fatbr br ingredients list banana version contains things ive never run across beforebr br organic rolled oats brown rice syrup earth balance expellerpressed natural soy palm canola olive oil blend filtered water pure salt natural flavor soy lecithin lactic acid nondairy annatto extract color organic sucanat nonrefined cane sugar dried bananas bananas fructose xantham gum contains soy may contain traces tree nuts peanutsbr br ingredient earth balance sounds meaningless pc days thats inordinately importantbr br annatto extract derived tropical achiote treebr br pure salt ingredients list foodstuff include impure saltbr br sucanat derived sucre de canne naturel dried sugar cane juice retains molasses contentbr br comes familiarity common ingredients list components need get perhaps offer nightschool class aging boomers local community collegebr br reason im awarding five stars ostensible banana taste subtle virtually nonexistent bobos version ive tried apricot also seemed minimally flavored muted essences unexpected something dense especially oats come across stronglybr br high points bar oat flavor mouth feel goes great cold moo juice despite high price local outlets per bar id buy make effort sample flavors see theyre better presentedbr br ps see review hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbzhkybobos oat bars natural chocolate ounce packages pack

Product was recalled for mold, but my 12pack was great.","great product, kind of expensive, especially when not on sale for 10$ or under for a twelvepack, which it does drop to on amazon quite often with Subscribe and Save.  I read lots of reviews of O.N.E. and VitaCoco, the two major brands I focused on because they seemed to have the most sales/least negative reviews out of the three best selling brands.  Frankly, Vita and ONE are really fairly close in taste, with O.N.E. tasting more natural, less of an aftertaste, and I think that's probably because Vita jams 240% of Vitamin C into each tetrapack.  That does alter the taste, making it slightly more acidic and to my tongue at least, not as fresh/tasty as O.N.E.  I haven't tried Zico yet, and based on some all over the place reviews, I'm probably not going to.  VitaCoco seems to have the same comments here and at a lot of other websites too, as in same wording, so I sort of doubt the veracity of half of Vita's reviews tbh, but regardless it's a great product too and I'd have no problem buying it again for the right price if this wasn't available or was at full price.  This was the first time I'd tried coconut water, and I was really surprised to find I liked it.  I was half expecting it to taste coconut-like, which it does not, which is good for me.  Closest thing I could think of to describe it would be if you can imagine drinking flavorless Gatorade, that's close.  Very refreshing/revitalizing, some slight natural sugar in it of course (none added), and really kinda tasteless.  The metallic taste people talk of I wonder if that might be because its just got so many electrolytes in it it sorta gives that tingle, not sure.  I did sorta notice it too, but it's hardly noticeable and not offensive.<br /><br />There was a product recall on this.  Amazon sent me an email saying it may have been mold contaminated and had been recalled.  I'd already guzzled the 12 pack a month before, and had drank down a case of Vita Coco too, so wasn't much for me to do.  I did find the box and checked UPC/exp date and it was not in fact affected by the recall, so in my single recall experience, Amazon erred on the side of caution, sending notices to people who weren't affected, as well as those who were, presumably.  That's good.  That's pretty encouraging.

After trying this for myself, I suspected that those high ratings were only illusions. My husband told me that company's consider these reviews as just another form of advertising and pay people to lie about a product's quality. I really can't imagine anyone thinking this product is drinkable, let alone, pleasurable. If you want a couple recommendations on decent tasting t-discs for your Tassimo machine, the Jacobs Latte Macchiato isn't bad if you add sugar. This morning though, I drank it after I tried the Voluptuoso and my mouth has a metallic taste to it. Not sure which one is responsible. Another thing, the milk in the disc tastes sour, but when you add sugar, there is a decent flavor there. For the 2nd decent beverage, you can take the Kenco Crema with some Coffee Mate's Spiced Pumpkin and Vanilla Spiced Chai (a liberal amount) creamers, with enough sugar, and have a nice smooth cappaccino. I've tried about nine flavors now, and the coffee, cremas, most lattes and cappaccinos, have the same inferior quality in looks and taste, as a cheap instant coffee, as well as, having your mouth taste like you just drank the contents of an ashtray. Kenco Crema is the only one that did not taste like nicotene. These are the coffees I've tried: Gevailia Cappaccino, Maxwell House - House Blend, Hag Crema Decaf, Jacobs Kronung, Carte Noire Voluptuoso Classic, Kenco Crema and Jacob's Macchiato. After finding one inferior brew after another, I've given up looking for a good cup of black coffee and/or cappaccino, for the Tassimo. Don't do what I did, which was believe all the positive reviews and downplay the critical reviews. My curiousity has been appeased after spending $34 in Tassimo beverages. Thankfully, 2 packages were free. Now I can either spend more money in S&H to return them, or drink all 56 cigarettes...I mean coffee.",wow thing get europe feel sorry trying suspected high ratings illusions husband told companys consider reviews another form advertising pay people lie products quality really cant imagine anyone thinking product drinkable let alone pleasurable want couple recommendations decent tasting tdiscs tassimo machine jacobs latte macchiato isnt bad add sugar morning though drank tried voluptuoso mouth metallic taste sure one responsible another thing milk disc tastes sour add sugar decent flavor nd decent beverage take kenco crema coffee mates spiced pumpkin vanilla spiced chai liberal amount creamers enough sugar nice smooth cappaccino ive tried nine flavors coffee cremas lattes cappaccinos inferior quality looks taste cheap instant coffee well mouth taste like drank contents ashtray kenco crema one taste like nicotene coffees ive tried gevailia cappaccino maxwell house house blend hag crema decaf jacobs kronung carte noire voluptuoso classic kenco crema jacobs macchiato finding one inferior brew another ive given looking good cup black coffee andor cappaccino tassimo dont believe positive reviews downplay critical reviews curiousity appeased spending tassimo beverages thankfully packages free either spend money sh return drink cigarettesi mean coffee

Certain flavors (particularly the yellow and green) left a strange flavor lingering in my mouth for a long time after I'd eaten just one of them.<br /><br />The fruit gems themselves did not fit very securely in the packing.  As soon as I removed the outer plastic wrap, I found the box covered in a sticky layer of sugar.  Inside the box, the gems had become all muddled up and were no longer in their set places.  The box was not divided into separate ""spaces"" for each gem, but instead split into two compartments where the gems were all just sort of tossed in together. I was hoping for some better presentation, and if this had been a gift, I would have been quite upset.  Additionally, the ratio of colors seemed somewhat poor:  I got a lot of reds and yellows, but very few yellows and greens, and not a single white one.  Not one!<br /><br />I didn't like these sweets much, because the yellows and greens (as I mentioned) left a particularly odd aftertaste and made my tongue feel weird.  The reds and oranges were not as strongly affected by this weird flavor, and I enjoyed them more.  They were quite irresistible!<br /><br />I'm not sure if I will be buying this product again.  The strange aftertaste was off-putting, and I would have been more disappointed by this product if there had been more greens and yellows in the box. I am glad that I mainly got reds and oranges; but this might not happen next time.  (I really liked the red and orange gems though, and wish I could just buy a box full of only them.)

Feldman ""Technophile""",4,4,5,1327536000,Bookers is a massive flavor bomb of cask strength bourbon richness.,"The top of the line of Jim Beam's Small Batch Collection, Bookers is a 127.9 proof monster (at least my current bottle).  Booker's a single barrel offering, and varies by proof and age from 121 to 127 proof (according to the web site, because the distiller chooses casks by flavor each cask is unique) and from 6-8 years in the barrel (for the same reason).  I guess my 127.9 proof example is ""pushing the envelope"" for Bookers.  I'm not complaining.  Alcohol is a flavor carrier and Bookers is a big flavor bomb.<br /><br />The dark tea orange color speaks of a heavy char in the barrels and you can smell it.  The toffee caramel aromas mix with the char to produce dark chocolate / cocoa notes.  There's also vanilla and tobacco and leather in there.  As Master Series reviewer Paul Pacult notes - there a ""paraffin"" note.<br /><br />Take a sip and pure sweetness hits first.  An intense sugar hit like maple syrup right on the tip of your tongue.  The midpalate mammoth wallop of orange fruit (citrus / apricot), toffee, and caramel corn hit a nanosecond later followed by spirit heat, wood tannins, oiled leather and vanilla aromatics from oak.  That paraffin note I own to Paul Pacult shows up here as well.  The high proof makes itself known in the huge midpalate hit and in a big spicy burn which hangs on for minutes as this bourbon finishes long and simple with a wood smoke, sugar glow, sourmash twang, and burnt orange throat bitterness.<br /><br />Wow!  I'm after another sip right away, but at this high a proof I must take my time.  The first big question is ""can I use water""?  You always can, but sometimes it robs a whiskey of its heart.  The answer here is ""yes you can"".  You can put quite a bit of water into Bookers and it still tastes clearly of Bookers (i.e. delicious).  It loses some intensity (particularly the aroma and midpalate explosion) but might gain something in the fruit esters department.  It certainly is easier to drink with some water.<br /><br />Bookers is clearly the most powerful bourbon flavor experience I've had so far.

Also, before the espresso starts coming out of the machine, the capsule makes a bit of a popping. Both of these issues are addressed on ECC's website, where they try to assure customers that this is normal and should not cause any concern.<br /><br />So, on to this particular variety, the Espressivo.  I'm a little surprised by the other reviews posted so far.  Unless the design of the CitiZ changed drastically, I'm not sure why one of the other reviewers was unable to use the ECC capsule.  As to the flavor, while I agree with the other reviewer so far that it isn't as good as Nespresso's darker roasts, I'm not in agreement that it's nothing more than bad drip coffee.  I actually think the Espressivo ECC capsule tastes okay -- definitely stronger than drip coffee -- and in my CitiZ it produced as much crema as a Nespresso capsule.  Unfortunately, however, the flavor seems kind of ""one note"" compared to my favorite Nespresso capsules.  Given that the cost of the ECC capsules on Amazon isn't that much less than Nespresso capsules available through the Nespresso club (about a 12% cost savings), one has to factor in the ""green"" factor of the ECC capsules to help them decide which capsule to choose.  While I personally feel a lot better about being able to compost the ECC capsules, I also want the best possible flavor from my CitiZ -- that's why I bought it instead of a much less expensive espresso machine.  I'm afraid that unless another variety of the ECC capsules is more to my liking, I'll be sticking with the Nespresso capsules.",tried varieties ecc capsules citiz machine far submit separate reviews different product listings coming daysbr br whats common capsules citiz machine little difficult close using ecc capsule versus nespresso capsule also espresso starts coming machine capsule makes bit popping issues addressed eccs website try assure customers normal cause concernbr br particular variety espressivo im little surprised reviews posted far unless design citiz changed drastically im sure one reviewers unable use ecc capsule flavor agree reviewer far isnt good nespressos darker roasts im agreement nothing bad drip coffee actually think espressivo ecc capsule tastes okay definitely stronger drip coffee citiz produced much crema nespresso capsule unfortunately however flavor seems kind one note compared favorite nespresso capsules given cost ecc capsules amazon isnt much less nespresso capsules available nespresso club cost savings one factor green factor ecc capsules help decide capsule choose personally feel lot better able compost ecc capsules also want best possible flavor citiz thats bought instead much less expensive espresso machine im afraid unless another variety ecc capsules liking ill sticking nespresso capsules

The Combos Cheddar Cheese PRETZEL blend is a tasty snack that leaves you satisfied.  I am no stranger to combos, my favorite happens to be the Nacho flavor.<br /><br />When it comes to flavor the Cheddar Cheese Pretzel combos are flavorful, and don't have an over salted-aftertaste you sometimes find with salty snack foods.  They do come off rather plain however, and the pretzel is a little overpowering.  Compared to the Cheddar Cheese CRACKER version, the Pretzel combination is the weaker of the two.  The cheddar cheese blend also lacks that a slight sharpness and has more of a Cheese-Wiz taste.  Nothing terribly wrong with that but it just feels like the weaker of the bunch.  The pretzel portion was crispy and fresh, having that pretzel-nugget taste to it.  Just the right amount of thickness and saltiness.<br /><br />OVERALL I'd say the Combos Cheddar Cheese PRETZEL combo is  4 stars.  The product makes for a very tasty snack, and will satisfy your cravings for both pretzels and cheese, but falls short of some of their other combinations.

I grew up with CoCo Wheats as a regular breakfast before school and/or work.  It can be made on the stove top or in the microwave.  It takes less than 2 minutes to make.  It has the following ingredients:  Wheat Farina, Cocoa, Calcium Phosphate, Artificial Flavors, Vitamin C, Niacin, Iron, Folate, Vitamin B12, B6, B2, And B1.<br />It has 200 calories per serving, of which only 10 come from fat.  It has 2 grams fiber.  It supplies about 25% of the essential Vitamin B's we need each day. There are 14 servings per box. Tip: make sure the plastic liner inside the box closes tight before placing back on the shelf.  You don't want moisture (or bugs) to get in the cereal!<br /><br />I have tried various toppings for sweetness: splenda (no calories), honey, maple syrup, and granular brown or white sugar.  My favorite is clover honey.  Pour on some milk, or a milk alternative like rice milk, almond milk, or soymilk before eating.  It really does taste delicious.<br /><br />No, it is not an all-natural cereal, but it sure tastes good, and is filling.

423566,B005VOONGM,A3CG6YLYZJXQG4,"Tracy Rowan ""dargelos""",0,0,3,1332979200,Not bad,"Unfortunately I got this coffee through the Amazon Vine program and nowhere in the description did it state that this product was for pod-type coffee makers. Also unfortunately, while the box says it holds ""single serve pods"" it does not specify that they're pods for a machine, or in fact what machines they work with.  The packets themselves say nothing at all about pods or machines.<br /><br />So here's the problem: I have a box of single serve coffee pods which don't really tell me much of anything, requested because I thought they were simply single-serve coffee bags, not unlike tea bags.  And I don't own a pod coffee maker.  I don't like them very much.  I'm going to have to improvise in order to do any sort of review.<br /><br />I tossed a couple of pods into my standard drip coffee maker and added two cups of water (The classic 6 oz cup by which coffee is still measured in spite of the fact that we now live in a world where 16 oz cups are considered small.) What I got back out was a brew that would make church coffee laugh derisively. So then I just threw two bags into a cup and added 12 oz of hot water, and let them steep until the brew looked darker, and that actually worked pretty well.  With due respect to the gentleman who said ""teabagging"" with these things doesn't work, I have to disagree.  It makes a decent enough cup.  The coffee isn't strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.<br /><br />In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.  Just remember that it's 1 pod to each 6 oz of water, no matter what the instructions say.<br /><br />Which brings me to a gripe.  Where the heck are people finding instructions?  There are none on the box, none on the individual packets.  The only instruction I found was on the pod itself.  One side says: ""This side down""  Seriously, even if your product is for a machine, it's a good idea to be clear about how to use the product in that machine.<br /><br />All in all, Marley Coffee got points for flavor but lost them for unnecessarily vague packaging and the fact that it's kind of pricey.  I don't honestly think that I'd change my review substantially even if I had a pod-style coffee maker to test it with, however if I do manage to find one and it changes my opinion, I will absolutely update this review.<br /><br />Amazon, you need to give a bit more information in your descriptions for Vine reviewers.

Your experience is important to us.<br /><br />BULL'S-EYE Original Barbecue Sauce is committed to bringing the flavor you enjoy, while minimizing the impact of rising commodity costs to ensure we're providing the best possible price to consumers.  To continue delivering the barbecue sauce you love we are now using high fructose corn syrup in all BULL'S EYE Original Barbecue Sauce.<br /><br />Product made with high fructose corn syrup can be identified by the ingredient statement on the back panel of the bottle.<br /><br />Our staff works very hard to provide the best tasting and satisfying products to the preferences of most consumers. Your opinion about the product is important to us as well and I will share your comments with our product development staff.<br /><br />Thank you again for taking the time to share your thoughts.<br /><br />Kim McMiller<br />Associate Director, Consumer Relations<br /><br />I say write to Kraft and let them know if you're unhappy with their decision.  I would be willing to pay a bit more to purchase sauce without HFCS.<br /><br />My original review follows:<br /><br />I love the taste of Bulls-Eye! I found out that I was on my last bottle of the 'original' - I like the other flavors as well - so I went by my local grocery, and I don't know why I looked on the ingredient list, but there at the top of the list, the main ingredient was High Fructose Corn Syrup! I was shocked. Didn't buy it of course, because besides the taste, I also love that I don't have to eat HFCS. I then checked the bottle I had at home. Unbelievably, my older bottle had no HFCS in it at all. So I'm savoring it for as long as I can until I can find a suitable replacement. What genius at the company took a ridiculously fantastic product and decided to ruin it?! Almost every BBQ sauce out there has HFCS in it, which is why I was so happy when I found Bull's-Eye.<br /><br />If you love Bull's-Eye as much as I do, please let the company know how much you enjoyed their original non-HFCS formula. It may be that this vendor still has some of the non-HFCS bottles, but I would check first. And if you can find bottles of the old recipe online, please post it so I can buy as much as possible until I can find another with great taste and no HFCS in it.

While it served its purpose as a cap to the evening meal quite nicely, it left me somewhat bemused.<br /><br />Not to put too fine a point on it, coconut was the only flavor discernable by me in the gustatory experience. Though obviously made with oats and containing chocolate chips, a taste of neither of those two ingredients came through.<br /><br />The ""mouth feel"" of the bar is pleasant enough. It's of medium density - as compared to the heavy density of a Bobo's Oat Bar (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZGW714"">Bobo's Oat Bars All Natural, Banana, 3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>) - and moist. Though the oat fiber is recognizably present in the texture, it's the flaked coconut that's most perceivable. The chocolate chips, while visible, contribute nothing at all in my opinion. (Again, if you're seeking a taste of oats, go to the Bobo's Oat Bar, which is very strong in that regard. If you're seeking the taste of chipped chocolate, don't dither about; go to a chocolate chip cookie, gluten-free if desired.)<br /><br />Pamela is apparently promoting an alternative snack for the nutritionally conscious and/or challenged as the packaging all but screams ""Wheat-Free"", ""Gluten-Free"" and ""Non-Dairy"", though the last claim is asterisked and clarified in the ingredients list with ""chunks may contain traces of milk protein due to manufacturing equipment.""<br /><br />The box also lists ""180 mg Omega 3 Fatty Acids"", ""9 Grams Whole Grains"" and ""0 Grams Trans Fats"", apparently for each 40 gram, 180 calorie, single-serving bar.<br /><br />To allow the buyers to feel altruistic when purchasing the product, it's also noted in the fine print that ""Pamela's Products donates to Celiac Sprue and Autism Support Organizations."" Celiac sprue is caused, of course, by dietary gluten intolerance.<br /><br />While I'd otherwise award at least 4 stars to this bar, I'm only going as high as three because the product's taste potential seems so badly misrepresented by its name.

Within a few days his rash was nearly gone, with no new spots.  I thought it was a coincidence, since it's clear from the ingredients that this is really just the standard mega-factory meat-byproduct diet in fancy packaging.  Then we tried his other food again because I had the flu and just could not get to the store that sells Chef Michael's, and within 24 hours he had new red raw spots.

She really loves the ""Duck"" Happy Hips the most for whatever reason, but she also likes the Chicken Vitality Treats and sometimes the Chicken Happy Hips.<br /><br /> She started eating these intially (when I first brought her home) because my local Safeway used to sell them at a decent price buy one, get one free. I would stockpile like crazy whenever they went on sale and as she got pickier and pickier as she got healthier these remained one of the few treats she would eat.<br /><br />Unfortunately I know that ""free range"" chicken (or duck, or any poultry, really) doesn't mean a thing as the requirements for a farm to be called free range are not stringent at all. Pretty much they will pile them up on top of each other but so long as they can ""touch the ground"" (not in cages) it's ""free range."" (Ugh, now I remember why I've been a vegetarian for 15+ years....)<br /><br />I have heard of a number of issues with the jerky chicken treats sourced from China and I keep closely monitoring her for any changes; in the interim I limit the amount of treats she gets anyway and the air dried raw food she eats is sourced from New Zealand. Hopefully I will eventually be able to find something to replace these with, but until then I'm fairly confident about them.<br /><br />After all, I feel better feeding these even if they ARE sourced from China because they are (at least) not irridiated and I feel better feeding these than the biscuit-style treats that have little nutriotional value.<br /><br />Unfortunately my Safeways finally stopped their buy-1 get-1 sales and raised their prices accordingly so I started orderign online via Amazon. I'm cautious whenever I open a new package of ANY kind of treats so I really like the fact that I now buy the larger packages for ""bulk"" discounts. It means I am using the same bags longer.<br /><br />Of course not all treats are for all dogs, and if I was starting from scratch I'd probably avoid feeding her these. (I really like Jones Natural Chews and would love to try their USA-sourced jerky) However, considering I'm on a very tight budget at the moment and she is picky beyond belief I have to made do.",far away dogs favorite treats ive always liked fact really pure jerky added beneficial ingredients really loves duck happy hips whatever reason also likes chicken vitality treats sometimes chicken happy hipsbr br started eating intially first brought home local safeway used sell decent price buy one get one free would stockpile like crazy whenever went sale got pickier pickier got healthier remained one treats would eatbr br unfortunately know free range chicken duck poultry really doesnt mean thing requirements farm called free range stringent pretty much pile top long touch ground cages free range ugh remember ive vegetarian yearsbr br heard number issues jerky chicken treats sourced china keep closely monitoring changes interim limit amount treats gets anyway air dried raw food eats sourced new zealand hopefully eventually able find something replace im fairly confident thembr br feel better feeding even sourced china least irridiated feel better feeding biscuitstyle treats little nutriotional valuebr br unfortunately safeways finally stopped buy get sales raised prices accordingly started orderign online via amazon im cautious whenever open new package kind treats really like fact buy larger packages bulk discounts means using bags longerbr br course treats dogs starting scratch id probably avoid feeding really like jones natural chews would love try usasourced jerky however considering im tight budget moment picky beyond belief made

Introduced in 1898, Grape-Nuts followed the first breakfast cereal (Granula) by a few decades, but stuck around much longer. They pre-date Kellogg's Corn Flakes by nearly a decade. Like Kellogg's early cereals, Grape-Nuts were initially marketed as a natural health food. Made from wheat and barley, without added sugar, they still pack a great deal of nutrition into a compact space. Each half-cup serving of Grape-Nuts contains 33 grams of whole grain, 48 grams of carbohydrates, 6 grams of protein and 7 grams of dietary fiber. They're low fat (1 gram per serving) and contain no trans fats.<br /><br />Grape-Nuts have a sweet, nutty wheat flavor and are very crunchy; too crunchy for some cereal eaters. The nuggets are small and soften slightly in milk. Those who prefer softer cereal can make hot grape nuts by adding a third-cup milk and microwaving the mix for 30-60 seconds. More time produces a softer result. Those who like something sweeter than the natural 4 grams of sugar per serving can add raisins, chopped fruit, a teaspoon or two of sugar, or sweetened soy milk. Their compactness also makes them a good pick for travel rations or backpacking, and a full serving is quite a bit smaller than for a typical flaked cereal.<br /><br />Grape-Nuts are great for breakfast, an afternoon snack or a treat before bed, and you can sprinkle them on yogurt to add some crunch!

115168,B007MN5QCK,ASCKW436WM1FD,GF FMer,0,0,5,1346544000,Fantastic tortillas!,"These tortillas taste great and are easy to make. The best part is that they have actual taste! They are definitely not a rubbery white rice disc like other GF tortillas I have tasted. Nor are they a large brown rice cracker! (I made the mistake of trying brown rice tortillas before I learned how sick they make me.)<br /><br />I have to be gluten free, fructose free and dairy free. These tortillas are a game changer for those of us who are gluten free but can't have brown rice because of the fructose content. My husband and I used to make Mexican food several times a week.  It was basically just our way of life before I was diagnosed with Fructose Malabsorption and a gluten sensitivity.  For the past 2 years, I have missed tortillas and Mexican food more than anything.  Finally, I can eat my steak burritos again!<br /><br />I would very highly recommend these to anyone who, like me, is constantly struggling to find something to fit into a very complicated diet with competing intolerances. The ingredients are simple but well balanced and the result is a very tasty tortilla. They don't really taste like wheat flour tortillas but they are way closer than any other rice tortilla I have had. And they are flexible and soft. I would never have guessed that this unassuming tiny brown bag would hold so much yummy goodness!  It would seem more fitting packaged in a golden bag with ribbons and balloons tied to it.  That would more accurately portray the fantastic-osity of its contents.<br /><br />Here are a few things we have learned about making these. We like to store them individually wrapped in foil and frozen. First we cook them, then allow them to cool in a Ziploc bag in the fridge, spread them out on baking sheets and flash freeze them and then individually wrap them. You can take them straight out of the freezer one at a time and toss them in the oven or on the BBQ (indirect heat or you'll turn them into crackers) and they come out warm and soft! Keep them tightly wrapped in the foil while you re-heat. They take about 3 minutes to warm up from frozen solid to warm, soft and delicious. I'm sure they do well in the microwave, too, but we haven't tried that yet.<br />The instructions say as you're cooking them to put them from the pan directly into a large ziploc bag and keep it sealed. My husband and I were pretty hesitant about that! It seems really wrong as you're making them because they're so hot right off the griddle, but do it anyway. It gets and keeps them good and moist. You can always dry them out when cooking but you can't re-add the moisture! Last, I found that putting between 3/4 cup and just a HARE shy of 1 cup of water helped to adjust for the high altitude instructions. They're really hard to roll out if you make the mix too moist so start on the dry side and add water by the teaspoon if necessary. Oh, and you'll need lots of tapioca flour to roll them out with!  We get 7 tortillas out of one bag of mix.<br /><br />The only way these tortillas could be any better is if they sold them pre-made and frozen. I would literally buy them by the case and happily pay extra for cold shipping to get them to me!  Thank you so much New Grains!  It sounds cheesy, but really, these have made a huge difference in my diet and, therefore, my life.  It's been so nice to eat a little more like I used to.  And, New Grains, PLEASE do consider selling them pre-made!  We'd be customers for life.",tortillas taste great easy make best part actual taste definitely rubbery white rice disc like gf tortillas tasted large brown rice cracker made mistake trying brown rice tortillas learned sick make mebr br gluten free fructose free dairy free tortillas game changer us gluten free cant brown rice fructose content husband used make mexican food several times week basically way life diagnosed fructose malabsorption gluten sensitivity past years missed tortillas mexican food anything finally eat steak burritos againbr br would highly recommend anyone like constantly struggling find something fit complicated diet competing intolerances ingredients simple well balanced result tasty tortilla dont really taste like wheat flour tortillas way closer rice tortilla flexible soft would never guessed unassuming tiny brown bag would hold much yummy goodness would seem fitting packaged golden bag ribbons balloons tied would accurately portray fantasticosity contentsbr br things learned making like store individually wrapped foil frozen first cook allow cool ziploc bag fridge spread baking sheets flash freeze individually wrap take straight freezer one time toss oven bbq indirect heat youll turn crackers come warm soft keep tightly wrapped foil reheat take minutes warm frozen solid warm soft delicious im sure well microwave havent tried yetbr instructions say youre cooking put pan directly large ziploc bag keep sealed husband pretty hesitant seems really wrong youre making theyre hot right griddle anyway gets keeps good moist always dry cooking cant readd moisture last found putting cup hare shy cup water helped adjust high altitude instructions theyre really hard roll make mix moist start dry side add water teaspoon necessary oh youll need lots tapioca flour roll get tortillas one bag mixbr br way tortillas could better sold premade frozen would literally buy case happily pay extra cold shipping get thank much new grains sounds cheesy really made huge difference diet therefore life nice eat little like used new grains please consider selling premade wed customers life
